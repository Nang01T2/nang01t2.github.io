The book *La dicha de ser maestro de obra por APAX* was a promotional and instructional manual that explained the benefits of using mortar over cement in certain circumstances.

**Glossary**

* Cement (Cemento): Fine powder used as a component in concrete, mortar, stucco, grout and thin-set adhesive. Composed of limestone, clay, shells, sand and iron heated to form a clinker that is then grounded into the fine powder. Commonly known as Portland cement, it's considered an hydraulic adhesive since it hardens when combined with water.
* Concrete (Concreto): Strong structural building material composed of cement, sand and a larger aggregate like gravel. It can be combined with metal reinforcement such as wire mesh or rebar (varilla corrugada) to increase its strength.
* Mortar (Mortero o Cemento de Alba単ileria): Composed of cement, fine sand and lime, used as binding material in many masonry (alba単ileria) works.
* Grout (Grout): Similar to mortar but without the lime additive, grout its just used to fill any gaps.
* Thin-set (Pegaporcelanato): Composed of cement, very fine sand and alkyl. Used to attach ceramic and stone tiles to a cement board.
* Stucco (Estuco): Type of mortar used to create decorations over the walls.
