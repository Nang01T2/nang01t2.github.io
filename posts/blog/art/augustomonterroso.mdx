***

His short story *The Dinosaur* was so popular that writers like Vargas Losa and Carlos Fuentes made Unicorn and Cocodrile parodies.

> "El Dinosaurio"
> 
> Cuando despertó, el dinosaurio todavía estaba allí.

Many writers would try to take the title of creating the shortest story ever written, in response Augusto made *Nulla ten sine linea* (Not a day without having drawn a line):

> "Nulla ten sine linea"
> 
> Envejezco mal -dijo; y se murió.
