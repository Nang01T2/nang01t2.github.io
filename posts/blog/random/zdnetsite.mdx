ZDNet is a tech news site[^1] made up of dozens of independent blogs[^2], owned and operated by Red Ventures[^3] alongside TechRepublic[^4]. The site was founded in 1991 by Ziff Davis[^5] as one of the first known efforts to distribute tech articles online. Originally called ZiffNet[^6], the site was only accessible under the servers of the CompuServe ISP[^7] as an expansion on an earlier digital bulletin board system called PCMagNet included in the PCMagazine[^8]. PCMagNet itself was a rebranding in 1988 of the original bulletin board launched in 1985.

In 1995 Ziff consolidated all his electronic publications under the single brand ZDNet and launched the public version of the site. ZDNet was finally bought in 2000 by its rival CNET Networks[^9] for $1.6M, in turn CNET would be later bought by CBS Corporation in 2008 for $1.8B. After CBS Corporation merged with Viacom to form ViacomCBS[^10] in 2019 ZDNet and TechRepublic were sold to RedVentures in 2020.

The website home page has an undeniable corporate feeling to it, with its articles and advertisements focusing entirely on the big business side of IT. In the site you can find a galley of technology photographs[^11], a section of videos with brief IT explanations[^12], reviews on various tech gadgets[^13] and their vast selections of articles[^14]. Since it is a news site you can also join their newsletters[^15]. Finally, alongside with TechRepublic they host a considerable library of software[^16] and white papers[^17], a legacy from their former owner CNET.
