IRC or Internet Relay Chat is an Internet Protocol to transfer text messages in a *Chat Room* or *Channel* which can be accessed through IRC clients in the same way that we use HTTP clients (Browsers) to access the Internet. Although it is one of the oldest services on the Internet its use has declined with the arrival of instant messages and social networks, despite this it's still used to obtain help and reach niche communities related to Open Source and many Hobbies.

Services such as [BotBot](https://botbot.me/) archive and decorate channels in order to store their activity so that no important ideas are lost over time. Register your nickname by messaging *NickServ*, to customize a channel or perform automatic tasks message *ChanServ*.
