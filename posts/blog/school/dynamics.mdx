# Introduction

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the state of rest or motion of bodies subjected to the action of forces.

* Statics: Study of bodies in equilibrium, either at rest or moving at constant speed.
* Dynamics: Study of bodies in motion with variable speed or undergoing acceleration.
* Kinetics: Study and analysis of the forces that cause motion.
* Kinematics: Study of the geometric aspects of movement through time.

**Movement**

1. Rectilinear Translation: The displacement vectors are parallel.
2. Curvilinear Translation: The displacement is not parallel but its orientation is.
3. Rotation Around a Fixed Axis: The object does not move, just its orientation.
4. General Plane Movement: There is a parallel and an orientation displacement.

We can define position, velocity and acceleration vectors of a rigid body:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\vec{r_B} = \vec{r_A} + \vec{r_{B/A}}\\
	\dot{\vec{r_B}} = \dot{\vec{r_A}} + \dot{\vec{r_{B/A}}} = \dot{\vec{r_A}}\\
    \vec{v_B} = \vec{v_A}\\
	\ddot{\vec{r_B}} = \ddot{\vec{r_A}} + \ddot{\vec{r_{B/A}}} = \ddot{\vec{r_A}}\\
    \vec{a_B} = \vec{a_A}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Rotation along a fixed axis**

Any point of the body moves in a circular path, however it does NOT experience angular movement, only lines or bodies do.

1. Angular Position: The angular position (r) is defined by $(\theta)$ from the origin.
2. Angular displacement: Change of the angular position, differential $d(\theta)$ in degrees, radians or revolutions (1rev = 2pirad).
3. Angular velocity: Change of angular position with respect to time, $\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \omega$.
4. Angular acceleration: Change in angular velocity with respect to time, $\frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \alpha$.

**Angular movement**

We can solve for $dt$ and obtain an equation that relates displacement, velocity and acceleration.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\omega = \frac{d\theta(t)}{dt} \implies \alpha d \theta=\omega d w\\
	\alpha(d\theta) = \omega(d\omega)\\
	\text{Constant angular acceleration}\\
	\omega = \omega_o + \alpha_c(t)\\
	\theta = \theta_o + \omega_o(t) + (0.5)(\alpha_c)(t^2)\\
	\omega^2 = \omega_o^2 + 2\alpha_c(\theta - \theta_o)
\end{gathered}
$$

The position of any point $P$ is given by $r$, if its body moves by $d(\theta)$ then the point will displace in an arc given by $ds = d(\theta)(r)$. The points velocity will be a tangent vector of the circular trajectory with its magnitude given by dividing the displacement by $dt$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{d(\theta)(r)}{dt}\\
	v=\frac{d(\theta)}{dt}(r) \implies v=(\omega)(r)
\end{gathered}
$$

It is not necessary to use $r$ to obtain velocity, we can use any $r_P$ that starts in the rotation axis and then solve with a vector product $v=(\omega)\times(r_P)$.

The point acceleration can be expressed using its normal and tangential components, the tangential component represents the change in velocity magnitude while the normal component represents the change in velocity direction. Note that the direction will always point to the rotation origin.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	a_t=\frac{dv}{dt} \land a_n=\frac{v^2}{r}\\
	v=(\omega)(r) \land \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}\\
	a_t=\alpha(r) \land a_n=\omega^2(r)
\end{gathered}
$$

Just like velocity ($v=(\omega)\times(r_P)$) the point acceleration can be alternatively expressed using a vector product.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Sum of a components}\\
	a  = (\frac{d\omega}{dt} \times r_P) + (\omega \times \frac{dr_P}{dt})\\
	v = (\omega)\times(r_P) = \frac{dr_P}{dt}\\
	a = (\alpha \times r_P) + (\omega \times ((\omega)\times(r_P)))\\
	a = (\alpha \times r_P) +((\omega^2)(r_P)) \implies a = a_t + a_n\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Given that $a_n$ and $a_t$ are perpendicular we can obtain the acceleration magnitude using the Pythagoras theorem $a=\sqrt{a_t^2 + a_n^2}$. For example:

When a motor generates $\alpha = 20e^{-0.6t}\text{rad/s2}$ in its propeller blades we can then calculate the rotational speed considering $t=3$ and the total revolutions in the time interval as $r = (1.75ft)$. Note that speed is just the angular velocity magnitude.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} \implies \alpha(dt) = d\omega\\
	\int_{0}^{\omega} d\omega = \int_{0}^{t} 20e^{-0.6t} dt\\
	\text{Solve the differential using an integral}\\
	\omega = -\frac{20}{0.6}(e^{-0.6t})\Big|_0^t = 33.3(1-e^{-0.6t})\\
	\omega = 27.82 \text{ rad/s}\\
	v = \omega(r) = 27.82(1.75) = 48.7 \text{ ft/s}\\
	\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} \implies \omega(dt) = d\theta\\
	\int_{0}^{\theta} d\theta = \int_{0}^{t} 33.3(1-e^{-0.6t}) dt\\
	\theta = 33.3(t+\frac{1}{0.6}(e^{-0.6t})\Big|_0^3 = 33.3(3+\frac{1}{0.6}(e^{-0.6(3)}-1))\\
	\theta = 53.63 \text{ rad} = 8.54 \text{ rev}
\end{gathered}
$$

Consider a motor with a gear A that turns with a constant acceleration of $\alpha_A = 4.5\text{ rad/s2}$ from rest. Calculate the cylinder C speed and the distance it travels in $t=3s$. Note that the rope is wound at D and fixed to gear B.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	a_t = \alpha_A(r_A) = \alpha_B(r_B) \implies (4.5)(75) = \alpha_B(225) \implies \alpha_B = 1.5\text{rad/s}^2\\
	\alpha_D = \alpha_B = 1.5\text{rad/s}^2\\
	a_c = (a_t)_D = \alpha_D(r_D) = (1.5)(0.125) = 0.1875 \text{ m/s2}\\
	v_c = v_o + \alpha_c(t) = 0+0.1875(3) = 0.563 \text{m/s}\\
	s_c = s_o + v_o(t) + (0.5)a_c(t^2) = 0+0+(0.5)0.1875(3)^2 = 0.844 \text{m}
\end{gathered}
