# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transforms them to signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Encoder, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the range of values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. The difference between the feedback and the input is the error signal used by the controller to drive the actuators needed to change the output closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes additional measurements.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature output and compares it with the reference, their error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes output. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower overall torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter equal to an ampere-turn per meter $At/m$.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla $T$.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber $Wb$.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #

![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

***

## Electromagnetic Relations ##

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}\\\\
	\text{i H Relation}\\
	\boxed{H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{B H Relation}\\
	\boxed{B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}}\\\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through, gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed i in Rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied Current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n))\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}\\\\
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	\boxed{B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)}
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

***

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

![Toroid Only](/static/images/notes/CreatingAToroidActuators.png)

A magnetic circuit can be made by looping a solenoid around a ferromagnetic toroid core so that most of the flux density will remain inside.  Here the solenoid field equation remains almost the same only that this time the unit of length instead of being the length of the solenoid will be the circumference of the toroid: $l = 2\pi r$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu)(n)(i) \land n = \frac{N}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies \oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\\\
	\text{Magnetomotive Force}\\
	\boxed{F = (H)(l) = (H)(2 \pi r) = (N)(i)}\\
	\text{Toroid Magnetic Circuit}\\
	\boxed{H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l}}\\
	\boxed{B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l}}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we are using a ferromagnetic core then $\mu$ must be considered relative to vacuum. From the equation of $H$ inside the toroid we can now calculate the flux $\Phi$ at any cross sectional area of the core.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA \implies \Phi = (B)(A)\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \implies \Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}} \implies \Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Flux Inside the Core}\\
	\boxed{\Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitInActuators.png)

We can use our knowledge of electric circuits with this magnetic circuit by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$. The main difference being that in this case power dissipation is not associated with reluctance.

**Magnetization Curve**

![Magnetization Curve](/static/images/notes/MagnetizationCurvesInActuators.png)

The magnetization curve represents how much $B$ will increase inside the material as we increase $H$, by driving a higher current for example. This relation is linear at low $H$ values but at some point the material will reach its saturation region. Note that the linear region is characterized by a low reluctance and the saturation region by a high reluctance. We can see that:

1. For different materials a different field strength is needed to achieve the same magnetic flux density.

***

## Magnetic Circuit with Air Gap ##

![Rotational Machine](/static/images/notes/RotationalMachineWithEquivalentActuators.png)

In rotating machines we leave an air gap between the core (rotor) and the solenoid (stator). This air gap is necessary to maintain the *frictionless* rotation of the motor shaft, in small motors its length is reduced to balanced the electromagnetic energy losses it produces but on bigger motors its length may be increased to protect the rotor from being pulled into contact with the stator. 

Air gaps introduce higher $F$ requirements to maintain the same flux density $\Phi$ inside the core however they allow the rest of the core to reach its saturation point safely. In the equivalent magnetic circuit model we account for air gaps as an additional reluctances $\Re_g$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} \land \Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g}\\
	F = (N)(i) = (H)(l) \implies (H)(l) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_c = \frac{\Phi_c}{A_c} \land B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Fringing Effect**

Since the air gap isn't contained inside a solenoid, flux lines will start to bulge outwards when magnetizing the core, this is known as the fringing effect. To account for then we normally increase the cross sectional area of the air gap therefore *capturing* the additional flux lines. Most of the time, if the air gap is relatively small, the fringing effect can be neglected.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Neglecting Fringing Effect}\\
	A_c = A_g = A\\
	B_c = B_g = B = \frac{\Phi}{A}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Circuit Air Gap}\\
	\boxed{F = (N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)}\\
	\boxed{B = \frac{\Phi}{A}}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Magnetic Circuit Inductance ##

The coil used in the magnetic circuit as the flux source can be thought of as an inductor where the inductance of the coil is defined as the Magnetic Flux Linkage $\lambda$ per Ampere of current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi)\\
	L = \frac{\lambda}{i} = \frac{(N)(\Phi)}{i} = \frac{(N)(B)(A)}{i} = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{i}\\
	L = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{\frac{H(l)}{N}} = \frac{(\mu)(A)(N)^2}{l} = \frac{N^2}{\Re}\\\\
	\text{Flux Linkage and Inductance}\\
	\boxed{\lambda = (N)(\Phi)}\\
	\boxed{L = \frac{N^2}{\Re}}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Hysteresis ##

![Hysteresis Curves](/static/images/notes/HysteresisCurvesMagnetActuators.png)

Magnetic hysteresis, from the Greek word of *being late*, means that the magnetic material will retain some residual magnetic flux acquired through the increase of the magnetic field strength. Once the material is magnetized an opposite magnetic field strength is needed to demagnetize the material, this is called the coercivity or coercive force.

Depending on the material, the current applied and the magnetic saturation you can form hysteresis curves of different shapes and sizes, in practice the bigger the hysteresis curve the lower the current needed to keep the core magnetized, the tradeoff is that this will also lower the overall response time of the actuator.

**Sinusoidal Excitation**

![Sinusoidal Excitation](/static/images/notes/SinusoidalExitationActuators.png)

When you apply an AC voltage source (with its corresponding current) to a magnetic circuit this will produce a sinusoidal excitation, since the coil acts as an inductor we will see a phase angle between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux. The relation between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux is determined by Faraday's Law.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi(t) = \Phi_{max}(\sin(\omega (t)))\\
	\Phi_{max}  = \text{ Flux Amplitude}\\
	\omega  = 2\pi f = \text{ Angular Frequency}\\
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\
	e(t) = (N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	e(t) = E_{max}(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{E_{max}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)}{\sqrt{2}}\\\\
	\text{Voltage Flux Relation}\\
	\boxed{E_{rms} = (4.44)(N)(f)(\Phi_{max})}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Permanent Magnet**

![Permanent Magnet](/static/images/notes/PermanentMagnetHysteresisCurveActuators.png)

By introducing a material with high hysteresis into the magnetic circuit path we are creating a permanent magnet. This permanent magnet will help maintain the magnetic flux we obtain with little to none additional current, generally the high hysteresis component or hard iron is made from iron, nickel or cobalt while the rest of the unmagnetized core is called the soft iron. 

Ideally after magnetizing the hard iron with a positive magnetic field and removing the applied current the permanent magnet will retain its maximum magnetic flux (point a), this is called its operating point. With a negative magnetic field ($-H_1$) we can adjust the operating point of the permanent magnet (to point b). 

From the hysteresis loop and the presence or absence of the keeper, the magnetic flux will be confined to the recoil line (line b to c) between the operating point (b) and the vertical axis (a). Note that removing the keeper makes the air gap the active magnetic field region of the circuit, meaning that the electromotive force of the air gap $F_g$ will equal the electromotive force of the permanent magnet $F_m$. Therefore, assuming no leakage, no fringing and no soft iron reluctance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_g = F_m \implies (H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0\\
	H_g = (H_m)\left(\frac{-l_m}{l_g}\right)\\
	\Phi = (B_m)(A_m) = (B_g)(A_g)\\
	B_m = \frac{(A_g)(B_g)}{(A_m)}\\
	B_g = (\mu_0)(H_g)\\\\
	\text{Permanent Magnet with Air Gap}\\
	\boxed{(H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0}\\
	\text{Shear Line Equation}\\
	\boxed{B_m = -\frac{(\mu_0)(A_g)(l_m)(H_m)}{(A_m)(l_g)}}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Shear Line](/static/images/notes/ShearLineImageDemagnetizeActuators.png)

The shear line equation represents the straight line that passes through the origin and the operating point of the permanent magnet, the intersection between the shear line and the demagnetization curve determines the new operating values (B and H) of the permanent magnet (hard iron). Note that if we reinsert the keeper then the operating point will move up the recoil line. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_m = (A_m)(l_m)\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)(A_g)(H_g)(l_g)}{(B_m)(H_m)}\\\\
	\text{Hard Iron Volume and Shear Line}\\
	\boxed{V_m = \frac{(B_g)^2(V_g)}{(\mu_0)(B_m)(H_m)}}
\end{gathered}
$$

The shear line equation can be used to relate volume of the hard iron needed to maintain a particular magnetic flux density inside the air gap. Note that since the hard iron removes the need of an applied current we can usually neglect the reluctance of the soft iron in the equivalent magnetic circuit.

# Energy Conversion #

![Energy Conversion](/static/images/notes/EnergyConversionDiagramStepsActuators.png)

The principle of conservation of energy is widely used when calculating the force or torque developed in an energy conversion machine. The electromechanical converter system has an electrical system, a mechanical system and a coupling field between them. 

* The electrical energy loss is mainly due to heating in the wires, this is known as the $i^2R$ resistance loss of the winding. 
* The magnetic field energy loss is due to the increase in the stored field energy of the core's field, also known as core loss. 
* Mechanical energy loss is due to friction and windage losses of moving components. All losses are converted into heat.

Neglecting the small resistance loss we know that the changes in the electrical energy applied $dW_e$ during a time interval $dt$ will produce a change in the energy supplied to the field (stored and lost) $dW_f$ and in the final mechanical energy $dW_m$ (useful and lost).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Conservation of Energy}\\
	\boxed{dW_e = dW_f + dW_m}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy Conversion Process ##

**Stored Field Energy**

![Energy Relay Example](/static/images/notes/FieldEnergyStoredInConversionActuators.png)

For example if we consider a relay where there is a movable part that is kept in static equilibrium by a spring $dW_m=0$ then every change in electrical energy will translate directly into a change in the magnetic field energy $dW_e=dW_f$. From this conditions we can calculate the change in electrical energy and the change in magnetic energy in the relay:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = \frac{N d\Phi}{dt}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \implies e(t) = \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\\\\
	\text{Electrical and Field Energy Change}\\
	\boxed{dW_e = (e)(i)(dt) \land dW_f = (i)(d\lambda)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the electrical and field energy change equations represent a machine with a fixed air gap length (no mechanical energy changes). By integrating the equations we can calculate the stored magnetic field energy $W_f$ or the induced electrical energy $W_e$ of the machine.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_f = (i)(d\lambda) \implies W_f = \int_{0}^{\lambda} i \, d\lambda\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) = (N)(B)(A)\\
	W_f = \int \left(\frac{(H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)}{N}\right) (N)(A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c) + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}\right) (A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c)(A)\,dB + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}(A)\,dB\right) \\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}((l_g)(A)) + \int \left((H_c\,dB)((l_c)(A)) \right)\\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}(V_g) + \left(\int (H_c\,dB_c)\right)(V_c)\\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g) = W_{fc} + W_{fg}\\
	w_{fc} = \text{ Energy Density In the Core}\\
	V_c = \text{ Core's Volume}\\
	W_{fc} = \text{ Energy In the Core}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Stored}\\
	\boxed{W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Normally $W_{fc}$ can be neglected when compared to $W_{fg}$. If the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	H_c = \frac{B_c}{\mu_c}\\
	w_{fc} = \int \frac{(B_c)\,dB_c}{\mu_c} (B_c) = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Density Approximation}\\
	\boxed{w_{fc} = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Energy and CoEnergy ##

![Mechanical energy curves](/static/images/notes/MechanicalEnergyCurvesActuators.png)

We know that the linkage - current (magnetic to electric) relation is dependent on the air gap length and the particular magnetization curve of the material. We call co-energy to the area under the linkage - current curve, in other words to the integral of the linkage with respect to the current $W_f'$ instead of the integral of the current with respect to the linkage $W_f$.

The co-energy has no physical meaning but is useful when trying to determine the mechanical energy that the machine has developed:

$$
W_f' = \int_0^{i} \lambda \, di
$$

Again, if the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
W_f' = W_f = \lambda (i)
$$

![Quasistatic And Non Change](/static/images/notes/QuasiAndNonQuasiChangeActuators.png)

When calculating the mechanical energy output we must consider that the system can't be in static equilibrium, this means the length of the air gap will change through time. This change in air gap length will correspond to an additional change in linkage (with respect to time) however we can neglect the additional change in current (with respect to time) as long as the movement is quasistatic.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{During motion}\\
	dW_e = \int (e)(i)\,dt = \int_{\lambda 1}^{\lambda 2} (i)\,d\lambda = A_{abcd}\\
	dW_f = A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\
	dW_m = dW_e - dW_f\\
	dW_m = A_{abcd} + A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\\\
	\text{Mechanical Energy Output}\\
	\boxed{dW_m = A_{0ab}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Here is where the concept of co-energy is useful since the area between the two linkage - current curves is in fact equal to the change in co-energy. Once we have calculated the mechanical energy output we can then obtain the mechanical force $f_m$ that caused the corresponding change in air gap length (Quasistatic or Energy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Quasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab} = dW_f'\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = dW_f'\\
	\boxed{f_m = \frac{dW_f'(i,x)}{dx}}
\end{gathered}
$$

If on the contrary the movement is non-quasistatic from a quick change in air gap length then we might consider that the linkage remains constant therefore the mechanical energy output will come entirely from the the field energy stored, meaning that the mechanical work done can be represented as a simple decrease in the field's energy (Non-Quasistatic or CoEnergy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{NonQuasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ap} = dW_f\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = -dW_f\\
	\boxed{f_m = -\frac{dW_f(\lambda , x)}{dx}}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Linear Systems ##

![Exercise of a Linear System](/static/images/notes/LinearSystemsFieldExerciseActuators.png)

If the mechanical force calculated from the energy and the co-energy is the same then the linkage - current relation is perfectly linear and the machine must be a linear actuator. When working with linear systems, as long as the core reluctance is negligible compared to its air gap reluctance then we can simplify the mechanical force equations by using the coil inductance equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = L(x)(i) \land W_f' = W_f\\ 
	W_f = \int (i)\, d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\lambda} \frac{\lambda}{L(x)} \, d\lambda\\
	W_f = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\\
	\text{Energy Method}\\
	f_m = -\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\right)\\
	f_m = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L^2(x))} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx} = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f(i,x)}{dx}\\
	W_f = \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2}\\
	\text{CoEnergy Method}\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2} \right) = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\\\
	\text{Linear Mechanical Force}\\
	\boxed{f_m = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Furthermore if the core reluctance is neglected then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(N)(i) = (H_g)(2)(g) = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0}(2)(g)\\
	W_f = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g)\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dg}\left( \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g) \right)\\
	\boxed{f_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(A_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Since the cross sectional area of the gap in this case is $(2)(A_g)$ then the force per unit area of the air gap or *Magnetic Pressure* can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Magnetic Pressure}\\
	\boxed{F_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0} \, N/m^2}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Rotating Machines ##

![Rotator and Stator](/static/images/notes/RotatorStatorComponentsActuators.png)

The moving part in a rotating machine is called *Rotor* and the fixed part *Stator*. The rotor is mounted on a shaft between the ends of the stator. The simplest rotating machine would supply two independent paths, one to the rotor and one to the stator, using two independent coils, with the rotor coil using fixed brushes and rotor slip rings. Both currents are taken into account to calculate their corresponding stored field energy:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{ Static Equilibrium}\\
	dW_f = (e)(i_s) \,dt + (e)(i_r) \,dt\\
	dW_f = (i_s) \,d\lambda_s + (i_r) \,d\lambda_r
\end{gathered}
$$

As with linear systems we can use the coil inductance function $L(\theta)$ (this time in terms of the angle) to represent the rotor and stator linkage. This coil inductance function can be further subdivided into its self inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$ and $L_{rr}(\theta)$) and mutual inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$) components.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda_s = L_{ss}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{sr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	\lambda_r = L_{rs}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{rr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	L_{sr} = L_{rs}\\
	dW_f = (i_s)d(L_{ss} i_s + L_{sr} i_r) + (i_r)d(L_{rs} i_s + L_{rr} i_r )\\
	dW_f = L_{ss} i_s  d(i_s) + L_{rr} i_r  d(i_r) + L_{sr} d(i_s i_r)\\
	W_f = L_{ss} \int_{0}^{i_s} (i_s)(di_s) + L_{rr} \int_{0}^{i_r} (i_r)(di_r) + L_{sr} \int_{0}^{i_s i_r} (di_s i_r)\\\\
	\text{Linear System Rotating Field Energy}\\
	\boxed{W_f = W_f' = \frac{L_{ss} i_s^2 }{2} + \frac{L_{rr} i_r^2}{2} + L_{sr} i_s  i_r}
\end{gathered}
$$

Just like the magnetic force we obtained from the stored field energy (with a constant current) we can also obtain the magnetic torque of the machine:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Linear System Torque}\\
	\boxed{T = \frac{dW_f'(i , \theta)}{d\theta}}\\
	T = \frac{i_s^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{ss}(\theta))}{d\theta}  + \frac{i_r^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{rr}(\theta))}{d\theta} + i_s i_r \frac{d(L_{sr}(\theta))}{d\theta}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the first two terms of the last equation are the *Reluctance Torques* produced from the variation of the self inductance as a function of the rotor position (angle) while the last term is the *Mutual Inductance Torque* produced from the variation of their mutual inductance, also as a function of the rotor angle. Reluctance Torque can be produced naturally from the change in air gap length as the rotor rotates inside the stator.

***

# DC Machines # 

## Electromagnetic Conversion ##

![Mutually Perpendicular](/static/images/notes/InducedVoltageandForceVectorsActuators.png)

A motor transforms electrical into mechanical energy, a generator mechanical into electrical energy, both use the stored magnetic field coupling as their intermediary. The electric or mechanical force that results from the transformation can be described in terms of the charges involved (Lorentz) or the conductors involved (Laplace).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Lorentz's Law}\\
	f = (q)(E + v + B)\\\\
	\text{Laplace's Law}\\
	\vec{F} = (i)(\vec{l} \times \vec{B})\\\\
	\text{Lenz's Law}\\
	e = (B)(l)(v)\\\\
	\text{Lorentz Force}\\
	f = (B)(l)(i)
\end{gathered}
$$

The Lenz's law describes the induced voltage in a conductor traveling through a magnetic field at a certain velocity (generator) while the Lorentz force describes the induced force in a conductor with an applied current inside a magnetic field (motor). In both cases the three vectors (field, length and velocity or current) are mutually perpendicular to each other. 

If the rotor or stator are subjected to a time variable magnetic field parasitic Eddy Currents might develop, to decrease the energy losses the core can be laminated.

***

## Machine Construction ##

![DC Machine Two poles](/static/images/notes/DiagramofTwoPoleActuators.png)

The rotor and stator have coil windings placed around multiple slots, in a DC machine the rotor has an armature winding while the stator has a field winding. The stator and armature can have multiple windings arranged in series or in parallel (derivation or shunt). Naturally the flux on the air gap generated by the field winding will be symmetric to its pole axis.

**Induced Voltage Rectification**

Rotating machines can be classified as DC, induction, synchronous or step machines based on how their windings interact. In DC machines there will always be a small loss in force as the armature rotates and is positioned between the field windings (interpolar range), this also causes an alternating field and induced voltage in the armature. We can use a mechanical commutator with a brush assembly or a circuit to rectify this alternating field.

![Two Pole DC Machine](/static/images/notes/SlipRingsandBrushesRectifyActuators.png)

We can clearly see the alternating field, induced voltage and magnetic flux distribution in the air gap when operating a two pole DC machine with sliding rings and a stationary brush assembly. 

![Commutator Segments First](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsMultipleCommutationSegments.png)

By replacing the sliding rings with two independent commutation segments we will be able to invert the direction of the current through the armature as it rotates (B1 always connected to a positive brush), this will help maintain a positive voltage. Note that the induced voltage of the armature windings will continue to alternate but will remain unidirectional when measured from its final armature terminals.

![Commutator Segments](/static/images/notes/RotationofCommutationSegmentsAcuators.png)

The current and induced voltage will go to the armature winding through the brushes and the commutator segments will invert the current direction as the armature passes through the interpolar region rectifying the signal. To further rectify the induced voltage (smoothing the movement of the machine) we can increase the number of armature windings with their respective commutation segments therefore decreasing the interpolar region.

![Turn and Winding](/static/images/notes/TurnCoilandWindingActuators.png)

All windings are formed from coils connected in series, however armature windings can be themselves interconnected in a Lap or Wave configuration based on the position of the brushes and terminals in relation to the poles.

![La Configuration](/static/images/notes/LapWindingInActuators.png)

In a Lap winding configuration the coils are simply laid in series, meaning that the number of parallel conductor paths will be determined by the number of poles along the winding, so in a 4 pole rotating machine there will be 4 parallel paths between the armature terminals. The number of brush positions is equal to the number of poles and parallel paths.

![Wave Configuration](/static/images/notes/WaveWindingConfigActuators.png)

In a Wave winding configuration the number of parallel conductor paths will always be two, independent of the number of poles along the winding. Even if the number of parallel conductor paths is always two the number of brush positions can be two or more.

***

## Armature Voltage ##

![Armatures Torque and Voltage](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsArmaturesTorqueAndVoltage.png)

Considering that a single loop (a to b) is made up from two conductors we can calculate the induced voltage as the loop rotates inside the field:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Voltage in an Armature's Loop}\\
	\boxed{e_t = (2)(B(\theta))(l)(\omega_m)(r)}\\\\
	\text{Average Voltage in an Armature's Loop}\\
	\boxed{e_{t avg} = (2)(B(\theta)_{avg})(l)(\omega_m)(r)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Considering that $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux per pole and $A$ as the area per pole then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B(\theta)_{avg} = \frac{\Phi}{A} = \frac{(\Phi)(p)}{(2)(\pi)(r)(l)}\\\\
	\text{Average Voltage in an Armature's Loop}\\
	\boxed{e_{t avg} = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(\omega_m)}{\pi}}
\end{gathered}
$$

The induced voltages of every single loop will contribute to the overall average voltage that will end up between the Armature's terminals ($E_a$ and $E_b$):
$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Average Voltage in the Armature's Terminals}\\
	E_a = \frac{(N)(e_{t avg})}{a} = \frac{(N)(p)(\Phi)(\omega_m)}{\pi (a)}\\
	\boxed{E_a = (K_a)(\Phi)(\omega_m)}\\
	a = \text{ Parallel Conductors per Loop}\\\\
	\text{Armature's Constant}\\
	\boxed{K_a = \frac{(N)(p)}{(\pi)(a)} = \frac{(Z)(p)}{(2)(\pi)(a)}}\\
	N = \text{ Loops in the Armature's winding}\\
	Z = \text{ Conductors in the Armature's winding}
\end{gathered}
$$

If the rotating machine is a generator then the average voltage at the terminals is the final voltage generated, if it's a motor then it will be the required voltage (electromotive force) required by the system. Using the Lorentz force we can calculate the force developed in one of the conductors (aa' or bb') that constitute an individual loop, so long as the loop is between two adjacent poles and is on the periphery of the armature winding.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Force in an Armature's Conductor}\\
	\boxed{f_c = B(\theta)(l)(I_c)}\\
	I_c = \frac{I_a}{a}\\
	I_c = \text{ Armature conductor's current}\\
	I_a = \text{ Armature terminal's current}	
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Developed Torque ##

From the armature conductor's force we can calculate its average torque, the contributions of every conductor's torque is the overall average torque of the armature.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Armature conductor's torque}\\
	T_c = B(\theta)(l)(\frac{I_a}{a})(r)\\
	\boxed{T_c = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(I_a)}{(2)(\pi)(a)}}\\\\
	\text{Average Armature's Torque}\\
	T = (T_c)(2)(N)\\
	T = \frac{(N)(\Phi)(p)(I_a)}{(\pi)(a)}\\
	\boxed{T = (K_a)(\Phi)(I_a)}
\end{gathered}
$$

In an ideal motor the electrical input power must equal the mechanical power generated:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Input and Output Power}\\
	(E_a)(I_a) = (K_a)(\Phi)(I_a)(\omega_m) = (T)(\omega_m)
\end{gathered}
$$

The last relation between electric and mechanical power is fundamental when trying to characterize a particular rotating machine from its Torque - Velocity curve.

***

## Generator Classification ##

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitForArmatureActuators.png)

We can use an equivalent magnetic circuit to describe the flux distribution inside a DC machine. The flux or the circuit's field current will be provided by the magnetomotive force ($F_p = Fmm$) at the field winding of each pole, the rest of the magnetic path consists of magnetic reluctances. 

Usually the magnetic flux path consists of a pole, the air gap, the rotor teeth, the core, the rotor teeth, the air gap, the opposite pole and the yoke back into the original pole. In most cases we can neglect every reluctance except the air gaps, assuming the rest of the path has infinite permeability we can calculate the flux per pole as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Magnetic Flux Per Pole}\\
	\boxed{\Phi = \frac{F_p}{\Re_g}}
\end{gathered}
$$

If the field current and therefore the flux increases at some point some parts through the magnetic path will start to saturate (usually the rotor teeth) slowing down the Flux - Fp curve. Using the magnetic circuit model it is common to represent magnetization as Armature Voltage - Fp (with a different curve for each armature speed).

![Magnetic Circuit Configurations](/static/images/notes/ShuntandWindingConfigurationsActuators.png)

Depending on how we excite the field windings and the field that the armature's magnetomotive force will interact with we can have different configurations. First we can divide them into separate excitation and self excitation. Self excitation (using residual magnetism in the poles) can be in series, in parallel (shunt) or compound. Compound self excitation can be short (series dominant) or long (parallel dominant).

* Separate Excitation: Field winding has higher number of loops but uses a lower current. The voltage output is independent of the load and can be easily regulated with the use of a rheostat (within the saturation limits of the magnetic circuit).
* In Series: Field winding has lower number of loops but uses a higher current. Magnetic flux is proportional to the current passing through the armature, to control its speed we must adjust its resistance. It has the highest starting torque and is resistant to additional loads since the armature will respond by lowering its speed, however it can only be excited while already in movement. 
* In Parallel (shunt): The voltage output can self regulate based on the load and its speed. They usually need backup generators or batteries to compensate unexpended load changes. This can be used to generate a small but stable torque for a wider range of speeds.
* Compound: Combines series and parallel configurations, it can achieve a greater torque for a wide range of speeds. A major disadvantage is that it can't be used to charge batteries. 

***

## Separately Excited Generator ##

![Separate Excitation](/static/images/notes/EquivalentLoadSeparateExActuators.png)

A DC generator is coupled to a constant velocity system and the armature terminals are connected to an electric load. In this case the field winding will be excited by an external DC source, in ideal conditions the inductor will behave as a short circuit meaning that its voltage will be zero. If the generator is in a stable state, meaning that the field and armature inductances can be neglected, then the following is true:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Terminals Voltage}\\
	V_t = E_a - R_a I_a\\
	V_t = I_t R_L\\
	\text{Field Winding Voltage}\\
	V_f = R_f I_f\\
	\text{Armature Voltage}\\
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a\\
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	I_a = I_t
\end{gathered}
$$

* $R_{fw}$ is the field circuit winding resistance
* $R_{fc}$ is the field circuit control resistance
* $R_f = R_{fw} + R_{fc}$ is the total field circuit resistance
* $R_a$ is the armature circuit (including brushes) resistance
* $R_L$ is the generator load resistance

1. Note that there is an armature voltage $E_a$ drop due to the armature resistance and another due to the armature reaction (AR).

**Armature Reaction (AR)**

![Armature Reaction](/static/images/notes/ArmatureReactionEquationsActuators.png)

Armature reaction is a demagnetization effect that happens when a current appears in the armature as a consequence of its induced voltage. At first all flux originates in the field circuit but as we increase the field current another develops in the armature generating an additional magnetomotive force. The force cancels out at first but as we continue to increase the field current and the circuit saturates then the armature reaction will cause a reduction of flux on one of the poles.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{No load}\\
	I_a = I_t = 0\\
	V_{t0} = E_{a0}\\
	\text{With load}\\
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a\\
\end{gathered}
$$

We can represent the reduction in flux and induced voltage as a reduction from the real field current into an effective current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Effective Current}\\
	I_{feff} = I_{freal} - I_{fAR}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Compensating Windings](/static/images/notes/CompensatingWindingsActuators.png)

An expensive and often rare way to compensate for the effects of armature reaction is to use additional compensating windings in series with the armature, the coils of this winding are inserted into slots at the poles generating an additional current that opposes the armature's reaction.

***

## Self Excited Generator ##

![Self Excitation](/static/images/notes/SelfExitationGeneratorActuators.png)

In this type of generator after the armature is turning at a certain velocity we turn off the applied field current. A small voltage will appear at the armature terminals from the residual magnetism $E_{ar}$, this voltage will create its own field current $I_{f1}$. If we reconnect the applied field current then its magnetomotive force $F_p$ will help reach a higher voltage at the armature terminals $E_{a1}$.

The newly induced voltage $E_{a1}$ will increase the field current again $I_{f2}$. The process repeats as long as there is some residual magnetism from the magnetization curve that the armature can use, note that for some residual magnetism to exist the resistance line must be lower to the critical field circuit resistance, the lower this resistance line is the higher the stable voltage we will achieve.

For self excitation to work there must be some residual magnetism that the armature can use, the winding field force must be enabled to help the gradual increase and the field circuit resistance line must be lower than its critical value.

![Voltage Current Char](/static/images/notes/CharacterVoltageCurrentActuators.png)

In a steady state operation on the load the self excitation machine has the following relations (assuming no armature reaction):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a\\
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	V_t = I_f R_f = I_f (R_{fw} + R_{fc})\\
	V_t = I_L R_L\\
	I_a = I_f + I_L
\end{gathered}
$$

Using the magnetization curve of a self excitation machine and its relation to the resistance line we can construct its terminal voltage - armature current characteristics curve. Notice that the maximum voltage drop to the field resistance line will happen when we have the maximum armature current. If there is no load then all the voltage originates from the starting residual magnetism, its corresponding current is called the short circuit current $I_{sc}$.
 
![Armature reaction](/static/images/notes/CondieringArmatureReactionCurActuators.png)

If we consider the armature reaction in a steady state self excitation machine we will notice that when there is an armature current present there will be an additional voltage drop given by $I_a R_a$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_t = V_a\\
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a = V_{ta} + (ab)\\
	I_{feff} = I_f - I_{fAR} = I_f - (bc)
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Compound Machines ##

![Compound machines types](/static/images/notes/CompuntMachineConfigurationActuators.png)

Compound machines can be divided into short shunt and long shunt interconnections with their unique steady state equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Short Shunt}\\
	V_t = E_a - I_a R_a - I_t R_{sr}\\
	I_t = I_a - I_f\\
	\text{Long Shunt}\\
	V_t = E_a - I_a (R_a + R_{sr})\\
	I_t = I_a - I_f\\
	I_f = \frac{V_t}{R_{fw} + R_{fc}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note from the magnetic circuit diagrams the additional series winding represented by the series resistance $R_{sr}$, the number of turns per pole in the series field winding $N_{sr}$ and the number of turns per pole in the shunt field winding $N_f$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	\text{Cumulative Compound}\\
	E_a = K_a (\Phi_{sh} + \Phi_{sr}) \omega_m\\
	\text{Differential Compound}\\
	E_a = K_a (\Phi_{sh} - \Phi_{sr}) \omega_m
\end{gathered}
$$

In a compound machine $\Phi_{sh}$ represents the flux per pole produced by the additional magnetomotive force of the shunt field winding while $\Phi_{sr}$ represents the flux per pole from the series field winding. Taking into account its effects we have:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_{eff} = F_{sh} \pm F_{sr} - F_{AR}\\
	N_f I_{feff} = N_f I_f \pm N_{sr} I_{sr} - N_f I_{fAR}\\
	I_{feff} = I_f \pm \frac{N_{sr} I_{sr}}{N_f} - I_{fAR}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Direct Current Motors ##

![Shunt Motor](/static/images/notes/ShuntandMotorGenPowerLossesActuators.png)

The DC rotating machine can operate as a generator or as a motor, when operating as a motor the same basic equations apply. We will have a fixed DC source at the terminals feeding the motor and a rheostat controlling its speed, notice that the armature current and speed will also very according to the mechanical load we apply.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_t = E_a + I_a R_a\\
	I_t = I_a + I_f\\
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	E_a = V_t - I_a R_a
\end{gathered}
$$

Finally in motors there will be a total power loss from the series field winding, the shunt field winding the armature circuit and any mechanical losses. In generators we have a similar power loss that originates from any rotational losses. The loss in motors and generators must be taken into account when calculating the machine's efficiency:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Motor Efficiency}\\
	\boxed{E_{ff} = \frac{P_{Output}}{P_{Input}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Torque Speed Relation**

![Torque Speed](/static/images/notes/TorqueSpeedCharactersitMotorsActuators.png)

Considering a separate excitation motor we can obtain its torque vs speed function using the following relations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	T = K_a \Phi I_a\\
	I_a = \frac{T}{K_a \Phi}\\
	\omega_m = \frac{V_t - I_a R_a}{K_a \Phi}\\
	\omega_m = \frac{- R_a}{(K_a\Phi)^2} (T) + \frac{V_t}{K_a \Phi}
\end{gathered}
$$

From the last relation we can observe that the motor speed can be controlled with:

![Armature Control](/static/images/notes/ArmatureControlActuators.png)

* Armature voltage control: Varying the voltage in the armature terminals (usually through an expensive variable source).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\omega_m = \frac{- R_a}{(K_a\Phi)^2} (T) + \frac{V_t}{K_a \Phi}\\
	\omega_m =  - K_2(T) + K_1(V_t)
\end{gathered}
$$

![Field Control](/static/images/notes/FieldControlMotorActuators.png)

* Field control: Varying the field current with a variable field resistance (rheostat $R_{fc}$), assuming magnetic linearity.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	K_a \Phi = K_f I_f\\
	E_a = K_f I_f \omega_m\\
	\omega_m = \frac{- R_a(T)}{(K_f I_f)^2} + \frac{V_t}{K_f I_f}\\\\
	\text{Without load then:}\\
	\boxed{\omega_m \approx \frac{V_t}{K_f I_f}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the constant $K_f$ depends on dimensions of the motor, the magnetic material and the number of turns in the field winding. This method is less expensive but due to the high field circuit inductance the change in the field current will be slow resulting in an overall slow speed response.

![Armature Resistance Control](/static/images/notes/ArmatureResistanceControlActuators.png)

* Armature resistance control: Varying the armature current with a variable armature resistance (rheostat $R_{ae}$).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Armature Resistance Control}\\
	\boxed{\omega_m = \frac{- (R_a + R_{ae})}{(K_a\Phi)^2} (T) + \frac{V_t}{K_a \Phi}}\\\\
	\omega_m =  - K_2(T) + K_1(V_t)
\end{gathered}
$$

This method is also easy to implement but is less efficient due to a loss in $R_{ae}$ as the rheostat must be able to carry the armature resistance.

**Series Motor**

![Series Motor Speed](/static/images/notes/SeriesMotorFieldControlSpeedActuators.png)

In a series motor configuration, where the armature and field circuits are in series, if we try to control the speed of the motor using a rheostat then the field control and the armature resistance control methods will be the same. We use series configuration for large startup torques (subways, car gears, blenders) at low speeds:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	K_a \Phi = K_{sr} I_a\\
	E_a = K_{sr} I_a \omega_m\\
	T = K_{sr} I_a^2\\
	E_a = V_t - I_a (R_a + R_{ae} + R_{sr})\\
	\omega_m = \frac{V_t}{K_{sr} I_a} - \frac{R_a + R_{sr} + R_{ae}}{K_{sr}}\\\\
	\text{Series Motor Control}\\
	\boxed{\omega_m = \frac{V_t}{\sqrt{K_{sr}}\sqrt{T}} - \frac{R_a + R_{sr} + R_{ae}}{K_{sr}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

# Induction Machines # 

![Induction Machines](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsThreePhaseConnections.png)

Induction machines are widely used since they work with AC sources instead of DC sources. Like a DC machine it has a stator, a rotor and an air gap between them, however in this case both windings carry alternating current (the stator directly and the rotor by induction). Household appliances generally use single phase motors while industrial applications prefer three phase induction motors. 

They usually have uniform air gaps, laminated steel sheet stators, laminated ferromagnetic rotors, three phase windings, slip rings connected to the rotor terminals and stationary slip ring brushes connected to an external source.

***

## Three Phase Connections ##

The three phase distributed windings can be represented as three concentrated coils with their axis 120 electrical degrees apart, each with a unique pair of poles. The terminals of the three phase windings can be connected in a star ($Y$) or delta ($\Delta$) configuration. If *balanced* the three phase connection will produce a rotating magnetic field of constant amplitude and speed in the air gap.

| Star Connection | Delta Connection |
| :---: | :---: |
| High voltage connection | Efficient conversion |
| Common neutral point | High torque |
| Neutral point can be grounded | Simpler design |
| Single phase at low voltages | Construction is cheaper |
| Separate circuit per phase | Used in conveyors |
| Dual voltage applications | Lower current per winding needed |
| Alternator needs fewer turns | Used in power applications |
| Wye alternator with less insulation | - |
| Low Torque | No neutral point |
| Combines three phases into one | Difficult ground fault detection  |
| Light duty cycle applications | Low voltage connection |
| Construction is more expensive | - |

When operating at a constant power output the star connection has high voltage and low amperage while the delta connection has a lower voltage but a higher amperage.

## Rotating Magnetic Field ##

![Rotating Induced Field](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramBalancedCurrentThree.png)

The polyphase windings in an AC machine produce a rotating magnetic field, each winding produces the same sinusoidal electromotive function but displaced by the 120 electrical degrees. Therefore in a balanced three phase machine we will have the following currents flowing through each winding:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	i_a = I_m \cos(\omega t)\\
	i_b = I_m \cos(\omega t - 120)\\
	i_c = I_m \cos(\omega t + 120)
\end{gathered}
$$

The resulting electromotive function is the sum of the three phase sinusoidal components. For a two pole, three phase winding machine, we have an instantaneous electromotive force of:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F(\theta) = F_a(\theta) + F_b(\theta) + F_c(\theta)\\\\
	\text{Electromotive Function}\\
	\boxed{F(\theta) = N i_a \cos(\theta) + N i_b \cos(\theta - 120) + N i_c \cos(\theta + 120)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![As a function of time](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramMagneticThreePhaseTime.png)

If we consider the currents of each winding as functions of time then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F(\theta, t) = N I_m \cos(\omega t) \cos(\theta) +\\
	N I_m \cos(\omega t - 120) \cos(\theta - 120) + \\
	N I_m \cos(\omega t + 120) \cos(\theta + 120) \\
	\cos(A) \cos(B) = (0.5)\cos(A - B) + (0.5) \cos(A + B)\\\\
	\text{Electromotive Wave Considering Time}\\
	\boxed{F(\theta, t) = \frac{3}{2} N I_m \cos(\omega t - \theta)}
\end{gathered}
$$

The last equation is the resulting magnetomotive force generated in the air gap, that rotates at a constant angular velocity of $\omega= 2 \pi f \,\,\text{rad/s}$, this wave moves along around the air gap for any given time. In a machine of $p$ poles one cycle of current variation makes the electromotive force wave rotate by 2/p revolutions, therefore the the field's speed in RPM ($n$) for a specific frequency is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Speed of the Rotating Field}\\
	\boxed{n = \frac{(2)(60)(f)}{p} = \frac{(120)(f)}{p}}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Induced Rotor Voltage**

![Rotor Voltage Induced](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramInducedThreePVoltageRot.png)

The rotating magnetic field results in an induced rotator voltage, using Faraday's law we can calculate the induced voltage expression:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Air gap flux Density}
	B(\theta) = B_{max} \cos(\theta)\\
	\text{Air gap Flux per Pole}\\
	\Phi_p = \int_{-\pi / 2}^{\pi / 2} B(\theta) (l) (r) (d\theta) = 2 (B_{max}) (l) (r)\\
	\text{Flux linkage variation for coil a}\\
	\lambda_a (\omega t) = N \Phi_p \cos(\omega t)\\\\
	\text{Induced Voltage}\\
	e_a = - \frac{d\lambda_a}{dt} = \omega N \Phi_p \sin(\omega t)\\
	\boxed{e_a = E_{max} \sin(\omega t)}\\
	e_b = E_{max} \sin(\omega t - 120)\\
	e_c = E_{max} \sin(\omega t + 120)\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Lastly we can calculate the rms induced voltage value for ideal and real (winding reduction factor $K_w$) conditions:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Induced Voltage in RMS}\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{\omega N \Phi_p}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 \pi f N \Phi}{\sqrt{2}} = 4.44 f N \Phi\\
	\boxed{E_{rms} = 4.44 f N_{ph} \Phi_p K_w}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Polyphase Induction Machine ##

There are multiple modes of operation for a polyphase induction machine, the two most important are the standstill and running conditions.

**Standstill Condition**

In a standstill condition (three phase wound rotor induction machine) the rotor circuit is left open therefore we have induced voltages in the stator and rotor at the same frequency (f1) given by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_1 = 4.44 f_1 N_1 \Phi_p K_{w1}\\
	E_2 = 4.44 f_1 N_2 \Phi_p K_{w2}\\
	\frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{N_1 K_{w1}}{N_2 K_{w2}}\\
	\frac{E_1}{E_2} \approx \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \text{Turns Ratio}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Running Condition**

Given the same machine the rotor circuit is now closed and the induced voltages in the rotor windings produce a rotor current that interacts with the air gap field generating the final rotor torque. From Lenz's law we know that the relative speed between the field and the rotor winding decreases until the rotor reaches a steady state speed ($n$) that is less than the synchronous speed ($n_s$) of the stator field. The difference between the rotor and the field speed is called the slip ($s$):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Rotor Speed Slip}\\
	\boxed{s = \frac{n_s - n}{n_s}}
\end{gathered}
$$

The second asynchonous frequency f2 (slip frequency) of the induced voltage and current in the rotor relates to this slip, because of the new slip frequency the rotor will have a new induced voltage $E_{2s}$ and rotating field speed ($n2$):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	f_2 = \frac{p(n_s - n)}{120} = \frac{p(s n_s)}{120} = (s)(f_1)\\
	E_2 = 4.44 f_2 N_2 \Phi_p K_{w2} = (s)(E_2)\\
	n_2 = \frac{120 f_2}{p} = \frac{120 s f_1}{p} = (s)(n_s)
\end{gathered}
$$

## Equivalent Circuit Model ##

We can use an equivalent circuit to describe the stationary and running conditions of a three phase wound rotor induction machine. We take advantage of the fact that the windings produce a rotating field with synchronous speed at a certain frequency f1 and that the induced voltage in the rotor has an asynchonous speed at a certain frequency f2. This relation can be modeled like a transformer (for balanced symmetrical polyphase windings).

**Stator Winding Circuit**

![Equivalent Circuit Stator](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramStatorWindingCircuit.png)

1. V1 = Stator Winding Terminal Voltage per Phase
2. E1 = Stator winding Induced Voltage per Phase
3. I1 = Stator Current
4. R1 = Stator Winding Resistance per Phase
5. X1 = Stator Leakage Reactance
6. Lm = Stator magnetizing Inductance per Phase
7. Rc = Stator Core Loss Resistance per Phase

 The resulting air gap flux is a combination of the stator and rotor currents (electromotive forces). The stator current can be broken into a load component ($I_2$) from the rotor current and an excitation component ($I_\Phi$) from the additional stator current needed to maintain the required air gap flux. The driving current can be broken into a core loss component ($I_c$) and a magnetization component ($I_m$).

**Rotor Circuit**

![Equivalent Circuit Rotor](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramEquivalentCircuitRotor.png)

From the stator point of view the rotor in displacement (s) can be represented by an impedance ($Z_2$) where:

1. E2 = Induced voltage at standstill per Phase
2. R2 = Rotor circuit resistance per Phase
3. L2 = Rotor leakage inductance per Phase

Since the rotor is at frequency f2 then the rotor current is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	I_{2s} = \frac{(s)(E_2)}{R_2 + j (s)(X_2)}\\
	P_2 = I_{2s}^{2} (R_2)\\\\
	\text{Rotor Current}\\
	\boxed{I_2 = \frac{E_2}{(R_2/s)+(j)(X_2)}}
\end{gathered}
$$

From the rotor circuit we can calculate the ideal power output per phase and the real power (considering the rotor copper loss) per phase. The real power relates to the final mechanical power output of the induction machine:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = I_{2}^{2} \frac{R_2}{s} = \frac{P_2}{s}\\
	P = P_{ag} = I_{2}^{2} \left( R_2 + \frac{R_2 (1-s)}{s} \right) = I_2^2 \frac{R_2}{s}\\
	P_2 = I_2^2 (R_2) = (s)(P_{ag})\\\\
	\text{Power Output}\\
	\boxed{P_{mech} = I_2^2 \frac{R_2 (1-s)}{s} = P_{ag} (1-s) = \frac{1-s (P_2)}{s}}
\end{gathered}
$$

In other words $P_{ag}$ is the generated power from the air gap field, $P_2$ is the power losses due to the rotor winding (copper loss) and $P_{mech}$ is the usable mechanical power taking into account the rotor winding losses. This means that efficient induction machines operate with low slip values in order for a greater fraction of the air gap field to be converted into mechanical energy (shaft power).

**Complete Equivalent Circuit**

![Equivalent Circuit Complete](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramEquivalentCompleteCirc.png)

By combining the stator and rotor circuit we have a complete equivalent circuit that behaves like a transformer, this means that the turns ratio $a = N_1 / N_2$ between the windings is considered.

![Equivalent Circuit Complete Simple](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramSimplifiedCompleteCircuitA.png)

We can simplify the complete circuit by moving the magnetizing branch ($R_c \land X_m$) to the input terminals if their voltage drop is negligable, then we can also remove $R_c$ if the core, friction and winding losses remain constant (constant rotational losses) when the induction machine source is operating at a constant voltage and frequency. The simplifications allow us to more easily calculate the exitation and load currents ($I_\Phi \land I_2$).

![Equivalent Complete Simplification](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramCircuitsSimpliThevenin.png)

**IEEE Equivalent Circuit**

Due to their air gap induction machines usually have a high excitation current $I_\Phi$ (30 to 50 percent) at full load, therefore their  leakage reactance is also high and their resistance $R_c$ can be ommitted. This equivalent circuit is preferable if the induced voltage $E_1$ differs considerably from the terminal voltage $V_1$.

**Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**

By using an equivalent thevenin circuit we just need to find $V_{th}$, $R_{th}$ and $X_{th}$, assuming $R_1^2 \ll (X_1 + X_m)^2$, then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	|V_{th}| = \frac{X_m}{\sqrt{R_1^2 + (X_1 + X_m)^2}} (V_1)\\
	V_{th} \approx \frac{X_m}{X_1 + X_m} (V_1) = K_{th} V_1\\
	Z_{th} = \frac{j X_m (R_1 + j X_1)}{R_1 + j(X_1 + X_m)} = R_{th} + j(X_{th})\\
	R_{th} = \left( \frac{X_m}{X_1 + X_m} \right)^2 (R_1) = K_{th}^{2} (R_1)\\
	X_{th} \approx X_1
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Performance Characteristics ##

From the equivalent circuit we can obtain the performance characteristics of the induction machine in a steady state, such as efficiency, power factor, current, starting torque and maximum torque. Note that the prime mark indicates that we are considering a turn ratio differential between the rotor and the stator windings (non-symmetrical transformer).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P_{mech} = (T_{mech})(\omega_{mech})\\
	P_{mech} = I_2^2 \frac{R_2 (1-s)}{s} = I_2'\frac{R_2' (1-s)}{s}\\
	\omega_{mech} = \frac{(2)(\pi)(n)}{60}\\
	\omega_{mech} = (\omega_s)(1-s) = \frac{n_s (2) (\pi) (1-s)}{60}\\
	P_{ag} = T_{mech} (\omega_s) = I_2^2\frac{R_2}{s}\\
	T_{mach} = \frac{P_{ag}}{\omega_s} = \frac{I_2^2 R_2}{\omega_s (s)} = \frac{(I_2')^2 R_2'}{\omega_s (s)}\\\\
	\text{Torque Function}\\
	\boxed{T_{mech} =  \frac{V_{th}^2 R_2'}{\omega_s (R_{th} + R_2' / s)^2 + (X_{th} + X_2')^2 (s)}}
\end{gathered}
$$

If we assume that $dT / ds = 0$ we will obtain rotor slip condition $s_T$ required to generate the maximum mechanical torque $T_{max}$:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{R_2'}{(s_T)} = \sqrt{R_{th}^2 + (X_{th} + X_2')^2}\\
	s_T = \frac{R_2'}{\sqrt{R_{th}^2 +(X_{th} + X_2')^2}}\\
	T_{max} = \frac{V_{th}^2}{2(\omega_s)(R_{th} + \sqrt{R_{th}^2 + (X_{th} + X_2')^2 })}\\\\
	\text{Maximum Torque}\\
	\boxed{T_{max} = \frac{V_{th}^2}{2(\omega_s)(\sqrt{(X_{th} + X_2')^2 })} , \, R_{th} \ll X}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Rotor Res and Torque](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramRotorResandTorque.png)

The maximum torque is independent of the rotor circuit resistance $R_2$, however it still plays a role in determining the rotor speed at which the maximum torque will occur, for every $R_2$ value we will have a different torque-speed curve. We can use this property to make the maximum torque coincide with the initial torque (standstill), this is how we achieve the highest possible starting torque.

**Stator Current**

We can obtain the stator current using the IEEE circuit and its input impedance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	Z_1 = R_1 + j(X_1) + X_m || \left( \frac{R_2'}{s} + jX_2' \right)\\
	Z_1 = R_1 + j(X_1) + X_m || Z_2\\
	Z_1 = R_1 + j(X_1) + \frac{j X_m (R_2' /s + j X_2')}{R_2'/s + j(X_2' + X_m)}\\
	Z_1 = |Z_1| \angle \theta_1\\\\
	\text{Stator Input Current}\\
	\boxed{I_1 = \frac{V_1}{Z_1} = I_\Phi + I_2'}
\end{gathered}
$$

At synchronous speed (no slip) $I_2' = 0$ so the stator current is equal to the excitation current $I_\Phi$. For high slip values $I_2'$ and $I_1$ are high (generally high to eight times the rated stator current). The input or supply power factor $PF$ can be calculated using the phase angle $\theta_1$ of the stator current $I_1$:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Power Factor}\\
	\boxed{PF = \cos(\theta_1)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Efficiency](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramEfficiencyEquivCirc.png)

**Efficiency**

To determine the efficiency of an induction machine we need to take into account various losses, for a three phase induction machine we can calculate the stator energy input $P_{in}$, the stator winding power loss $P_1$ and the rotor winding power loss $P_2$:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P_{in} = (3)(V_1)(I_1)(\cos(\theta_1))\\
	P_1 = (3)(I_1^{2})(R_1)\\
	P_2 = (3)(I_2^2)(R_2)
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Efficiency Slip](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramEfficiencyandSlip.png)

The efficiency, just like in a DC machine, is the ratio between the output and input power. In the case of induction machines the efficiency will be highly dependent on the rotor slip and in most cases it is the only loss we can't neglect.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Efficiency}\\
	\boxed{\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_{mech} - P_{rot}}{P_{in}}}\\
	P_{ag} = P_{in}\\
	P_2 = (s)(P_{ag})\\
	P_{out} = P_{mech} = P_{ag}(1-s)\\
	\eta_{ideal} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = (1-s)
\end{gathered}
$$

# Hydraulic Actuators #  

![Hydraulic Actuator](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramHydraulicValvesSolenoid.png)


Linear actuators are widely used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems. For example electrohydraulic spool type valves can be found in automatic transmissions by regulating the pressure and flow of the clutch when making a gear change, they work by using a current controlled solenoid (Usually 0-1.2 Amps) to change the position of a piston or spool and with the use of multiple ports (holes) allow for the fluid to take different paths.

We can model an electrohydraulic valve as a cylindrical solenoid with a vertically movin piston mass (M) with guiding bushings of thickness (g) and diameter (d). The permeability of the bushing (acting as the air gap) is of $\mu_0 = 4(\pi) \times 10^{-7} \,\, \text{H/M}$. Sometimes the piston is supported by a spring with a K constant and an applied force ($F_t$) (Mechanical Force). 

The coil will have (N) turns, a resistance of (R), a terminal voltage of ($V_t$) and an applied current of (i). For now we will ignore magnetic losses and steel reluctance effects. Note that the superior air gap has a variable area therefore its reluctance will vary with respect to time. From the data we can calculate the dynamic differential equations of the system in terms of the dependent variables $i \land x \land V_t \land F_t$.

**Force Of a Cylinder**

Considering $k(x-l_0)$ as the mechanical spring constant and its compression, then we can use Newton laws to calculate the Motion Equation of the piston.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_t = \frac{(\pi)(D)^2(P)}{4}\\
	F_{fld} + F_t - F_D - F_k = ma\\
	\text{Motion Equation}\\
	F_{fld} + F_t = m(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}) + B(\frac{dx}{dt}) + k(x-l_0)\\
	\text{Electric Equation}\\
	V_t = (i)(R) + e = (i)(R) + \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\\
	L(x) = \frac{N^2}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \Re_1 + \Re_2 = \frac{g}{\mu_0 \pi d} \left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{a}\right)\\
	\Re = \frac{g}{\mu_0 \pi a d} \left(\frac{a + x}{x}\right)\\
	L(x) = \frac{\mu_0 \pi a d N^2}{g} \left(\frac{x}{a + x}\right)\\
	L(x) = L'(\frac{x}{a + x})\\
	F_{fld} = \frac{\delta W_{fld}' (i,x)}{\delta x}\\
	F_{fld} = \frac{i^2}{2}\frac{\delta L(x)}{\delta x}\\
	F_{fld} = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{\mu_0 \pi a d N^2}{g} \left(\frac{a+x-x}{(a+x)^2} \right)\\
	\text{Upward Piston Force}\\
	F_{fld} = \frac{a L' i^2}{2(a+x)^2}\\
	e = \frac{d\lambda}{dt} = \frac{d(Li)}{dt}\\
	e = \frac{(L)di}{dt} + (i)\frac{dL}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt}\\
	\text{Induced Coil Voltage}\\
	e = L' \left(\frac{x}{a+x}\right)\frac{di}{dt} + (i)\frac{a L'}{(a+x)^2} \frac{dx}{dt}
\end{gathered}
$$

By substituting the magnetic field strength and the induced voltage we obtain the final motion and electric equation (considering the calculated inductance):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Motion Equation}\\
	\boxed{F_t = m(\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}) + B(\frac{dx}{dt}) + k(x-l_0) - \frac{a L' i^2}{2(a+x)^2}}\\\\
	\text{Electric Equation}\\
	\boxed{V_t = (i)(R) + L' \left(\frac{x}{a+x}\right)\frac{di}{dt} + (i)\frac{a L'}{(a+x)^2} \frac{dx}{dt}}\\\\
	\text{Considered Inductance}\\
	\boxed{L' = \frac{\mu_0 \pi a d N^2}{g}}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Fluid Fundamentals ##

![Fluid Properties](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramFluidProperties.png)

Fluids are characterized by their relative incompressibility and continuous deformation after an applied shear force. Hydraulic systems use liquids and pneumatic gases as their power transmission mediums. Density (Mass Density) is the mass of a substance per unit of volume. Viscosity (given in poise) is the resistance of a fluid to deformation after shear force is applied and represents the internal friction of the substance.

One way to measure absolute or dynamic viscosity ($\mu$) is to enclose the sample inside a cylinder with a radial space of ($C_r$) and apply shear force to it using a piston, the resistance of the fluid to the piston for a particular contact area and velocity (displacement derivative) will be proportional to the viscosity.
$$
\begin{gathered}
	F = \mu (A) \frac{dx}{C_r}\\
	F =  \frac{(\pi)(D)(L)(\mu)}{C_r} \frac{dx}{dt}
\end{gathered}
$$

If we consider that the piston eccentricity and the radial space are very small then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = \frac{(3)(\pi)(L)}{(4)(f_{exc})} \left( \frac{D}{C_r} \right) 
\end{gathered}
$$

The ratio between absolute viscosity and mass density is used in many fluid equations (Reynolds Number, Navier Stokes) known as kinematic viscosity (given in stokes). One way to measure kinematic viscosity is to measure the time that $60\text{cm}^3$ of a sample take to flow through a tube of $0.176\text{cm}$ of diameter and $1.225\text{cm}$ of length, the resulting time is called Saybolt Universal Seconds (SUS) and it can be used to approximate the kinematic viscosity (given in cSt):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	v = \frac{\mu}{\rho} = 0.216(SUS) - \frac{166}{SUS}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Hydraulic Cylinder](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramHydrailicCylinder.png)

There is a spring effect of the liquid and the mechanical parts of the system, this spring effect therefore creates resonance in the hydraulic components and is proportional to the Bulk Modulus. We can observe the effect if we consider a cylinder with a starting total volume ($V_t$) that is then compressed, increasing in pressure finally decreasing its starting volume.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_t = V_l + V_g\\
	\Delta V_t = - \Delta V_g - \Delta V_l + \Delta V_c\\\\
	\text{Effective Bulk Modulus}\\
	\boxed{\frac{1}{\beta_e} = \frac{\Delta V_t}{V_t \Delta P}}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Fluid Visc and Temp](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramFluidViscosityandTemp.png)

The viscosity of liquids decreases as the temperature increases. The absolute viscosity-temperature curve can be approximated using the following relation (where $\lambda$ is a substance specific constant):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Viscosity Temperature Curve}\\
	\boxed{\mu = (\mu_0)(e^{-\lambda(T-T_0)})}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Flow in Orifices ##

![Fluid Orifices](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsDiagramOrificesandFlow.png)

There are many forces that affect fluid flow including gravity, buoyancy, inertia, surface tension, and electromagnetic fields. Usually the most relevant forces are the fluid viscosity and inertia and their ratio is called Reynold's number (where $\bar{u}$ is the average flow velocity):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Reynold's Number}\\
	\boxed{R = \frac{\rho (\bar{u})(a)}{\mu}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that when viscosity forces dominate the flow of the fluid we will observe laminar flow (smooth, orderly parallel lines) and when inertia forces dominate we will observe turbulent flow (irregular, erratic spiral paths). Laminar flow in closed conduits with non circular cross sections considers an hydraulic diameter of $D_H = \frac{4A}{S}$, where A is the cross sectional area and S is the flow section perimeter.

We use orifices (short length flow path restriction) in basic fluid control systems, to satisfy the continuity law the flow velocity must increase at the orifice. If the fluid has a relatively high Reynold number then the pressure drops from the acceleration of fluid particles to a higher jet velocity, at low Reynold numbers the pressure drops from the viscosity induced shear forces.

The pressure differential required to accelerate the fluid particles to a higher jet velocity ($u_2 = Q$) can be found using Bernoulli's equation ($u_2^2 - u_1^2 = \frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho}$), combining it with the continuity equation ($A_1 u_1 = A_2 u_2$) and applying a viscous friction coefficient ($C_v \approx 0.98$) that decreases the final fluid jet velocity:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Jet Velocity}\\
	\boxed{Q = \left(\frac{C_v A_2}{\sqrt{1 - (\frac{A_2}{A_2})^2}}\right) \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho}}}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

We can obtain the jet velocity if we only consider the hole area, in this case $C_d$ is the discharge coefficient with a typical value between 0.6 and 0.8.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Orifice Jet Velocity}\\
	\boxed{Q = C_d A_0 \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

We can obtain a similar equation if we know that the orifice will produce laminar flow, in this case $\delta$ is a geometry constant with a typical value of 0.2 for a circle with sharp edges.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Laminar Flow Jet Velocity}\\
	\boxed{Q = \frac{(2)(\delta)^2(D_H)(A_0)}{\mu}}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Valves and Hydraulic Control ##

![Valves](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsValvesSpoolConfigurations.png)

Valves can be divided into Sliding, Seating and Flow Dividers. Sliding valves with spools are the most common type, spool valves can be further subdivided into Flow Path Number, Piston Number or Center Type when neutral.  

Types of CENTER

***

## Valve Analysis ##

![Valves](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsGeneralAnalysisandAreaSpool.png)









There are many forces in the spool known as fluid induced forces or hydraulic reaction forces and they are the result of flow passing through the valve chambers and ports, they are inherent to the nature of fluid acceleration as it travels through a hole.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_j = \rho (V)\frac{Q_2^2}{A_2V} = \frac{\rho Q_2^2}{A_2} = \frac{\rho Q_2^2}{C_c A_2}  
\end{gathered}
$$

The reaction to the fluid induced forces can be subdivided into an axial and a lateral component, the lateral component pushes the piston towards the sliding cylinder causing friction, this can be mitigated by locating the ports symmetrically, the axial component acts in the direction of the piston that closes the valve port. Since $Q_1 = Q_2$ then we can apply the orifice equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	Q_1 = Q_2 = C_c C_v A_0 \sqrt{\frac{2(P_1 - P_2)}{\rho}}\\
	F_1 = (2)(C_d)(C_v)(A_0)(P_1-P_2)(\cos(\theta))\\
\end{gathered}
$$

There is a clear relationship between the orifice opening or clearance and the jet angle of the fluid induced force. For small openings the jet angle becomes 21 degrees as we can see in the graph.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Axial Component}\\
	\boxed{F_1 = (2)(C_d)(C_v)(w)(P_1-P_2)(\sqrt{x_v^2 + C_r^2})(\cos(\theta))}
\end{gathered}
$$

Another source of lateral forces is due to leakage through the pistons since it is very difficult to have a perfect cylinder there will always be an inclination that will causa a lateral force that decentralizes the piston. By making grooves in the piston plungers we can mitigate this effect, they need to be at least 10 times the clearance in size and perpendicular to the axis. One can reduce the effect to 40%, three to 6% and seven to 2.7%

Bleed type valves are used to control flow instead of pressure and come in many types like ball or poppet valves. Hydraulic Cylinders are linear actuators that use the energy of an hydraulic circuit to perform mechanical work, the flow under pressure sent by an actuator acts on the face of the piston moving it a certain distance (stroke). 

Hydraulic Cylinders can be classified into single acting and double acting, in the first case hydraulic pressure extends the piston but a different force contracts it, in the second case the hydraulic pressure performs both actions. Rotating Cylinders are used to rotate work elements or operate process control valves, we can find them as Rotary vanes or Worm gear and pinion.
