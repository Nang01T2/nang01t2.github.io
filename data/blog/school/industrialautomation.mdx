**Automation in Production Systems**

1. Automation of manufacturing in the factory
2. Computerization of manufacturing support systems.

Manufacturing support systems are connected to the factory manufacturing systems with computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). Today CIM adds potential automation apps and potential computerization apps, all united to create an automation and computerization cycle.

![CIM](/static/images/notes/IntegrationComputerIntManu.png)

Objectives of CIM are to reduce the amount of effort and to integrate computer aided design and manufacturing with their business functions. Examples of automated manufacturing systems are automated machine tools, transfer lines, assembly systems, industrial robots, material handling, storage and inspection systems.

**Industrial Revolutions**

1. First Industrial Revolution: Power Generation with the introduction of the power loom in 1784, mechanization of production facilities with water and steam.
2. Second Industrial Revolution: Industrialization with the assembly line in slaughterhouses in 1870 and electrification of the facilities.
3. Third Industrial Revolution: Electronic automation with the first PLC in 1969 and electronics that automate processes.
4. Fourth Industrial Revolution: Smart automation with cyber-physical-systems, German adoption of Industry 4.0 in 2011, IoT and the introduction of IPv6 in 2012.

**Production Business Models**

* General Purpose Machine Tools: Up until 1850 the industry was dominated by craft production (high variety and low volume) slowly shifting into mass production from the first industrial revolution. 
* Dedicated Manufacturing Lines: In 1955 the industry reached its peak into mass production systems (low variety and high volume) coinciding with the second industrial revolution. 
* Flexible Manufacturing Systems: In 1980 we see a new shift into mass customization (medium variety, high volume) from more competitive markets and diverse customer needs. 
* Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems: In 2000 globalization divided industry into two trends, regionalization and personalized production. (high variety, medium or low volume).
* Additive Manufacturing and Digitalization: The future of the industry is uncertain but individual production is one possibility.

![Bussines Models Example](/static/images/notes/IntegrationBussinessModels.png)

The market can have a steady demand where there is low competition since supply is lower than demand or have a variable demand where there is high competition since supply is higher than demand.

***

**Automation**

Automation is the process using specialized equipment and devices that control the manufacturing processes to perform sequence of operations with little to no human labor involved. It can be divided into active and passive automation based on its sensor usage, actuators, unit tracking and costs.

* Globalization market that started in the 90's.
* International Outsourcing to Mexico, China, India, Vietnam etc.
* Local outsourcing or Nearshoring from USA to Mexico.
* Future restrictions and laws from the Covid19 Global pandemic.
* Contract Manufacturing: Companies manufacture entire products instead of parts.
* Product Service Systems trend in regional economies, for example maintenance.
* Highest quality expectations from consumer and corporate customers.
* Operational efficiency is a priority to overcome cheap labor competition.

**Production Systems**

Production systems are a collection of people, equipment and procedures created to accomplish the manufacturing operations of a company. Note that particular production systems such as specialized plant layouts depend heavily on the business model used.

1. Facilities: Factory and equipment such as tooling, material handling, inspection, computers, PLC's, any physical resource and the plant layout, all needed to control manufacturing operations. 
2. Manufacturing support systems: Internal procedures used to manage production and logistics related to orders, prioritization, quality assurance, storage, production line, stand alone workstation, workers and inventory.

![Business Models Two](/static/images/notes/IntegrationProduictionBussinessTwo.jpg)

1. Manual Work Systems: A worker performs one or more tasks on a work unit without the aid of powered tools and relying on hand tools.
2. Worker Machine System: A worker operating powered equipment.
3. Automated System: Process performed by a machine without the direct participation of a human.

Manufacturing support systems involve a cycle of information processing activities that  must perform four functions in the company. Note that design and planning communicate one way into the facilities while business and control communicate both ways.

1. Business Activities: Sales, marketing, order entry, costs, accounting and billing of a customer order.
2. Product Design: Research and development, design engineering, prototype shop.
3. Manufacturing planning: Process planning, production planning, capacity planning and MRP. 
4. Manufacturing control: Inventory, quality and shop floor.

**Manual Labor**

There is a place of manual labor in modern production systems when:

* The cost of manual labor is so cheap that it outperforms automation.
* The task is too technologically difficult, for example with composite materials.
* The production cycle is so short that automation would be a wasted investment.
* Human flexibility is required in highly customized products.
* It reduces the risk of product failure and it can be adjusted for demand.
* Product designers who bring creativity to the task.
* Manufacturing engineers that design tools and plan the production routing.
* Equipment maintenance, programming, and plant management are done by humans.

Automation replaces manual labor in order to:

1. Increase productivity.
2. Reduce labor cost per unit.
3. Mitigate effects of labor shortages.
4. Reduce or remove repetitive clerical tasks.
5. Increase safety and quality.
6. Reduce lead time (from the order to the costumer).
7. Accomplish tasks that can't be done manually.
8. To be competitive in an automated market.

**Automation Levels**

Every automation level has a bidirectional communication with the next level:

1. Device: Sensors, actuators and hardware elements that form individual control loops.
2. Machine: Industrial machines like CNC made from multiple devices.
3. Cell or System: Manufacturing system made from multiple machines.
4. Plant: Factory or production system made from multiple cells.
5. Enterprise: Corporate information system made from the planning of plants.

![AutomationPyramid](/static/images/notes/IntegrationAutomationPyramid.png)

Remember that the automation of factory manufacturing systems and the computerization of manufacturing support systems overlap because they are connected via a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) system.

***

**Automation in Production Systems**

1. Dedicated or Fixed Automation (millions): High production volumes and rates. High initial investment from custom engineered equipment. Inflexible for product variation. Mass production such as Coca Cola.
2. Flexible Automation (thousands): Continuous production of variable mixes of products. High initial investment for custom engineered systems. Medium production rates. Highly flexible working with multiple products at the same time. Introduces reconfigurable manufacturing. For example the AMRC Factory 2050.
3. Programmable Automation (hundreds): Lower production rates. High initial investment from general purpose equipment. Flexibility to deal with the highest product variation. Batch production where physical setup and software changes can happen between batches, for example cookies of different flavors, robots and CNC machines.

Reconfigurable manufacturing was created by the Japanese industry in WW2 and can be thought of as the precursor to programmable automation, by manually changing the configuration of the tools used by the machine it could work on different products. Flexible automation does this automatically and can change between entirely different tools.

**Automation Principles**

1. USA Principle:
   1. Understand the process: Analysis of inputs, outputs, value chain, charting techniques and mathematical modeling.
   2. Simplify the process: Reduce unnecessary steps and moves. Including Just in Time methods to reduce unnecessary storage.
   3. Automate the process: Use the migration strategy principle to automate.


![Value Chain Analysis](/static/images/notes/IntegrationValueChainAnalysis.png)

![Charting Technique 1](/static/images/notes/IntegrationOperationProcessChart.png)

![Charting Technique 2](/static/images/notes/IntegrationFlowProcessChart.png)


1. Migration Strategy Principle:
   1. Phase 1 or Manual Production: Single station manned cells working independently, low set up time and low cost tooling.
   2. Phase 2 or Automated Production: Single station automated cells operating independently. Can be justified when demand grows.
   3. Phase 3 or Automated Integrated Production: Multi station system with serial operations and transfer of work units between stations.

![Migration Strategy](/static/images/notes/IntegrationMigrationStrategy.png)

**Manufacturing**

Manufacturing can be defined in technological terms as the process where a starting material is transformed into a completed part or product and scrap or waste by combining machinery, tools, power and labor. In economics manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of greater value by one or more operations, in other words it is a process that adds value to the material.

**Industry Classification by Manufacturing**

1. Primary: Cultivate and exploit natural resources directly from earth such as agriculture and mining.
2. Secondary: Industries that convert raw materials into products such as construction, power generation and every manufacturing company.
3. Tertiary: Service sector, instead of tangible products they offer services, often with the help of primary and secondary industries, such as banking, education, government, transportation, retail, etc.
4. Quaternary: Tourism or the *chimneyless industry* is considered by some as the fourth industry.

Another way to classify them is based on the continuity of the final product:

1. Discrete product industries: Continuous production or batch production of discrete products and parts such as cars, appliances, machines or components.
2. Process industries: Continuous production or batch production of continuous products such as metals, beverages, petroleum, gas, foods, chemicals and power generation.

![Discrete Industries](/static/images/notes/IntegrationProcessAndDescreteInd.png)

**Manufacturing Operations**

Basic activities done in a factory to convert raw materials into finished products. For example, for discrete product industries we have:

1. Processing and assembly operations: Melting, milling, robot arms, people.
2. Material handling operations: Forklifts, conveyors, hoists, cranes AGV's, monorails.
   1. Can be divided into transport, storage, unitizing equipment and AIDC's (automatic identification and data capture) such as bar codes or RFID's.
3. Inspection and testing operations: Inspection is the examination of the product to determine if they conform to design specifications. Testing is observing the product or its components during actual operation or similar conditions.
   1. Inspection can be done through measuring (variable inspection) or gaging (attribute inspection). Testing 
4. Coordination and control operations.

Note that most of the time in a manufacturing process is used in moving and waiting for material handling operations, from the five percent left almost seventy percent is used on loading, positioning and gaging operations.

![Discrete Industries](/static/images/notes/IntegrationClassificationManufacturing.png)

**Product Variety and Quantity**

* Production Quantity: Number of units of a given part or product produced annually by the plant.

![Production Quantity and Variety](/static/images/notes/IntegrationProductionQuantityAndVariety.png)

* Production Variety:
  * Hard Product Variety: Products differ greatly, there are few common components in an assembly.
  * Soft Product Variety: Small product differences, there are many common components in an assembly.

**Plant Layout Types by Quantity**

Companies attempt to organize its facilities, specifically their plant layouts, to be the most efficient at serving their particular goals. Depending on the manufacturing type, the particular product, the production quantity and variety we can choose a different plant layout.

1. Fixed Position
2. Functional Production (Process Layout)
3. Cellular Manufacturing
4. Quantity Production
5. Flow Line Production (Product Layout)

* Low Production (Fixed Position or Process Layout):
  * Low quantities of specialized and customized products (job-shop and workshop).
  * Includes production of most components using general purpose equipment.
  * Products are complex, such as specialized machinery or prototypes (line production).
* Medium Production: 
  * Using Batch Production: Changeover takes time (setup), typical layout (process), hard product variety.
  * Using Cellular Manufacturing: Typical layout (cell), soft product variety.
* High Production:
  * Using Quantity Production: Standard machines for high production (mass production), typical layout (process).
  * Using Flow Line Production: Requires multiple processing or assembly steps, typical layout (product).

![Integration Layouts](/static/images/notes/IntegrationPlantLayouts.png)

**Manufacturing Models and Metrics**

1. Cycle Time
2. Production Rate
3. Production Capacity
4. Availability
5. Utilization
6. Manufacturing Lead Time
7. Work In Progress

Cycle time is the time that one work unit spends being processed or assembled, in other words it is the time between when one unit begins its processing until the next.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T_c = T_o + T_{th} + T_h\\
	T_c = \text{Cycle in Min per pc}\\
	T_o = \text{Operation Processing in Min per pc}\\
	T_{th} = \text{Tool Handling in Min per pc}\\
	T_h = \text{Handling in Min per pc}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Descrete Types](/static/images/notes/IntegrationDiscreteTypesPro.png)

Production rate $R_p$, in terms of pc per hour, is the hourly production rate and is based on the type of discrete production:

* Sequential Batch

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T_b = T_{su} + Q(T_c)\\
	T_p = \frac{T_b}{Q}\\
	R_p = \frac{1}{T_p}\\
	T_{su} = \text{Setup Time of Machine in Min per pc}\\
	T_{r} = \text{Transfer Time in Min per Cycle}\\
	T_{p} = \text{Average Production per Unit in Min per pc}\\
	R_{c} = \text{Machine Operation Cycle Rate in pc per hr}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Job Shop Production

$$
\begin{gathered}
	Q = 1, \quad T_p = T_c + T_{su}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Quantity Mass Production

$$
\begin{gathered}
	R_p = R_c = \frac{60}{T_c}, \quad 0 = \frac{T_{su}}{Q}
\end{gathered}
$$

* Flow Line Production

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T_c = T_r + T_{o,max}, \quad R_c = \frac{60}{T_c}
\end{gathered}
$$

Production capacity $PC$ (not to be confused with pc piece) is the maximum rate of output of a production facility (line, work center or group of work centers) under a given set of operating conditions, namely the number of shifts per day, the number of hours per shift and the employment levels. Note that in the case of a plant or factory we use plant capacity instead.

The simplest case of production capacity is when $n$ number of machines all produce the same component or product at the same rate $R_p$:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	PC = (n)(H_{pc})(R_p)\\
	PC = \text{Production capacity per time period}\\
	H_{pc} = \text{Number of hours per time period}
\end{gathered}
$$

Availability relates to the time a particular machine is available to perform an operation between its failures and repairs:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	A = \frac{MTBF - MTTR}{MTBF}\\
	MTBF = \text{Mean Time Between Failures}\\
	MTTR = \text{Mean Time Between Repairs}
\end{gathered}
$$

Utilization is the amount of output of a facility relative to its production capacity, making it a reliability metric that indicates how much time the machine is actually working properly.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	U = \frac{Q}{PC}
\end{gathered}
$$

Manufacturing lead time, in minutes per batch, is the time required for a given product to be completely processed by a plant. This metric includes any lost time due to delays, time in inventory, reliability problems and other unexpected circumstances.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	MLT = (n_o)(T_{su} + (Q)(T_c) + T_{no})\\
	n_o = \text{Number of operations per batch}\\
	T_{su} = \text{Setup time in Min per batch}\\
	Q = \text{Quantity of products in pc per batch}\\
	T_c = \text{Cycle time in Min per pc}\\
	T_{no} = \text{Non Operation Time in Min per batch}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, suppose a certain part is produced in 100 unit batches. The batches are routed through five operations to complete the parts. Average setup time is 3 hours per batch. Average operation time is 6 minutes per pc. Average non operation time is 7.5 hours per operation. Assuming the plant runs 8 hours per day and 5 days per week calculate the lead time.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	MLT = (5)(3 + (100)(\frac{6}{60}) + 7.5)\\
	MLT = 102.5 \, \text{hr} = \frac{102.5}{8} = 12.81 \, \text{days}
\end{gathered}
$$

Work in Process, in pieces, is the quantity of products currently located in the factory being processed or between operations, in other words it is the inventory of the raw material being in the state of being transformed into a product.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	WIP = R_{pph} (MLT)\\
	R_{pph} = \text{Plant Production Rate in pc per hr}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Operations Costs per Year**

Manufacturing costs can be classified into:

1. Fixed costs: Costs that remain constant for any output level.
2. Variable costs: Costs that increase with the output level.

Therefore the total annual costs in dollars per year can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	TC = FC + (VC)(Q)\\
	FC = \text{Fixed Annual Costs}\\
	VC = \text{Variable Annual Costs}\\
	Q = \text{Annual Quantity Produced in PC per yr}
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, suppose two methods are compared, one manual and one automated. The manual method produces 10 pieces per hour, requires one worker at 15 dollars per hr and has a fixed cost of 5000 dollars per yr. The automated method produces 25 pieces per hour, has a fixed cost of 55000 dollars per yr and a variable cost of 4.5 dollars per hour. Determine the break even point, the point when they have the same annual costs. Note that the manual method has a variable cost of $VC_m = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5$ dollars per piece.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	TC_m = 5000 + (1.5)(Q)\\
	VC_a = \frac{4.5}{25} = 0.18\\
	TC_a = 55000 + (0.18)(Q)\\
	5000 + (1.5)(Q) = 55000 + (0.18)(Q)\\
	1.5Q - 0.18 Q = 1.32Q = 55000 - 5000 = 50000\\
	1.32Q = 50000 = \frac{50000}{1.32} = 37879\, \text{pc}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Overhead**

Another way to classify manufacturing costs is:

1. Direct labor: Wages and benefits paid to workers.
2. Materials: Cost of raw materials.
3. Overhead: Every other expense associated with running the company.
   1. Corporate Overhead: Security, taxes, research, legal, engineering, office, accounting, sales, marketing, executives, finance, lighting.
   2. Factory Overhead: Plant supervision, maintenance, custodial, security, tool crib, taxes, insurance, light, machines, payroll, material handling, depreciation, shipping.

![Typical Manufacturing](/static/images/notes/IntegrationTypicalManufactoringCosts.png)

The factory overhead rate and the corporate overhead rate can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	FOHR = \frac{FOHC}{DLC}\\
	COHR = \frac{COHC}{DLC}\\
	FOHC = \text{Annual Factory Overhead in dollars per yr}\\
	DLC = \text{Annual Labor Costs in dollars per yr}\\
	COHC = \text{Annual Corporate Overhead in dollars per yr}
\end{gathered}
$$

The hourly cost, in dollars per hr, of a worker machine system can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	C_o = C_L (1 + FOHR_L) + C_m (1 + FOHR_m)\\ 
	C_L = \text{Labor rate in dollars per hr}\\
	FOHR_L = \text{Labor factory overhead rate}\\
	C_m = \text{Machine rate in dollars per hr}\\
	FOHR_m = \text{Machine factory overhead rate}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

**Computer Process Control System**

Sensors (analogue or digital) and actuators work together with a computerized process control system to manage the feedback loops in any manufacturing process. Their placement depends if the manufacturing process equipment works with discrete or continuous products.

![CPCS](/static/images/notes/IntegrationComputerProcessControl.png)

**Sensors**

* Sensor: Element in a mechatronic or measurement system that detects the magnitude of a physical parameter transforming it onto a signal that can be processed. It responds into a physical stimulus and transforms it into another physical variable that can be measured.
  * Active: They require additional energy or excitation to work.
  * Passive: They use the energy of the thing they are measuring to work.
* Transducer: Transforms a physical energy into another directly. It can't perform signaling conditioning methods, normally they are contained in a sensor.
* Sensors by Stimulus:
  * Mechanical: Position, velocity, force, pressure, torque, stress, strain, mass, density.
  * Electrical: Voltage, current, charge, resistance, conductivity, capacitance.
  * Thermal: Temperature, heat, heat flow, thermal conductivity, heat.
  * Radiation: Gamma, visible light, intensity, wavelength.
  * Magnetic: Field, flux, conductivity, permeability.
  * Chemical: Identities, concentration, pH level, toxicity, pollutants.
* Proximity Sensors: Contact Sensors, Interrupters, Inductive Sensors (Ferromagnetic Metals), Hall Effect Sensors (Magnetic Field), Capacitive Sensors (All Materials), Ultrasonic Sensors (Distance) and Optical Sensors (Photoelectric, Beam, Retroreflective, Reflective).

![Proximity Sensors](/static/images/notes/IntegrationProximitySensors.png)

* Linear distance or angular position: Potentiometric Sensors, Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDT), Rotational Variable Differential Transformers (RVDT), Lasers (Laser Triangulation), Pulse Ranging Technology (PRT), Encoders. 

![Sensors](/static/images/notes/IntegrationSensorsVaried.png)

**Actuators**

Devices that convert controller signals into physical actions, it is a transducer since it changes a type of energy into another generally from electrical into mechanical.

1. Electrical Actuators: Motors, DC servomotors, AC motors, stepper motors, step motors, stepping motors, solenoids.
2. Hydraulic Actuators: Use hydraulic fluid to exert grater forces due to the incompressibility of fluids.
3. Pneumatic Actuators: Compressed air and less powerful than hydraulics.

![Comparison Pneumatic Hydraulic](/static/images/notes/IntegrationComparisonHydraulicPneumatic.png)

![Power Transmission](/static/images/notes/IntegrationPowerTransmission.png)

Power elements or stages (drivers) are components needed to interface digital controllers with devices of great mass, heat or flow by increasing the controller power output.

Motors are devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical energy (rotatory or linear), used in applications where controlled movement is necessary at a constant speed or with a smooth start and stop. Motor selection depends on:

* Required power, speed and torque.
* Start, stop, inversion conditions needed.
* Variable or constant speed. Directional changes.
* Operation conditions like temperature, pressure, dust, etc.

Other actuators include linear stepper motors, pneumatic rotational motors, cylinders, pistons, solenoid valves, pneumatic electro-valves, 

***

**Numerical Control Safety**

Normally there is a physical barrier of plastic of metal that protects against projectiles of the scrap metal. Two magnetic sensors and a pin make the machine work only when in contact meaning that the protection is closed.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used when working with CNC machines. That includes head protection, eye protection, ear protection, breathing protection, gloves, fall arrest, clothing and footwear protection.

**Common NC Machining Operations**

* Drilling a workpiece with a drill bit at a certain angular speed and feed.
* Milling a workpiece with a cutter at a certain angular speed, depth and feed.
* Horizontal milling a workpiece with a drill around a shaft at a certain angular speed.
* Turning a workpiece with a cutter while the piece rotates and chips away a new surface at a certain depth.

For flat and prismatic (Block Like) parts we use milling and drilling operations on a conventional Cartesian coordinate system with rotational axes about each linear axis.

For rotational parts (Cylinders) we use turning operations on a conventional Cartesian coordinate system (With No Y axis). In this case it is the part and not the tool that rotates.

![Vertical and Horizontal Milling](/static/images/notes/IntegracionMillingMachinesDif.png)

**Applications of NC**

Machine tool applications include:

1. Milling, drilling, turning, boring, reaming, grooving, counter boring, grinding, etc.
2. Machining centers, turning centers, milling-turning centers.
3. Punch presses, thermal cutting machines, etc.

Horizontal Milling operations include:

1. Slab Milling: Known as plain milling, cutters remove large amounts of material for a wide slot or to level the surface.
2. Side and Face Cutter: Cutters have cutting edges around the circumference and on the sides of the teeth. Used for shoulders and slots.
3. Angle Milling: Used with single angle cutters to cut at a specific angle for chamfers or bevels while double angle cutters create grooves.
4. Face Milling: Large cutters designed for heavy cutting for the highest removal of material.
5. End Milling: Equivalent to routers for cutting wood, they can side mill, plunge cut and center cut the workpiece.
6. Milling Dovetail Slide: Dovetails or shank tools cut specific angles into the sides of precut slots.
7. Woodruff Keyway: Smaller milling cutters with a shank, they refer to the small pieces of metal used to mate rotating shafts and gears.

**Fundamentals of NC Technology**

Numerical Control is a form of programmable automation where the mechanical actions of a machine are controlled by alphanumeric data that represents the relative positions between a workhead (tool) and a workpart. NC can be divided into a program of instructions (part program with machining operations), a MCU or machine control unit and the processing equipment that performs the program. Other NC applications include:

* Component insertion in electronic assemblies.
* Drafting machines (x-y plotters).
* Coordinate measuring machines.
* Tape laying for polymer composites.
* Filament winding for polymer composites.

![Lathe CNC Machine](/static/images/notes/IntegracionLatheCNCMachine.png)

Example of other NC machines include Electrical Discharge Machine (EDM), Wire Jet (Plasma or Laser), or Inspection Machines (CMM). The use of NC machines is recommended when there are repeated orders, complex geometries, large quantity of metal removal, many sequential operations, expensive parts or batch and workshop productions.

Note that we use Jigs, Clamps, Handles and other fixtures to process or test the workpieces or products inside an NC Tool machine.

![Types of CNC Machines](/static/images/notes/IntegracionTypesofCNCMachines.png)

Advantages of CNC machines include:

1. Productive time increased.
2. Low scrap rates.
3. Inspection requirements reduced.
4. Complex part geometries possible.
5. Easier to make changes to the design.
6. Simpler fixtures.
7. Great accuracy and repeatability.
8. Short lead times.
9. Reduced inventory and floor space.
10. Lower operator skill level requirements.

Disadvantages of CNC machines include:

1. High investment cost
2. High maintenance effort.
3. Part programming complexity.
4. Higher utilization is required.

**MCU and DNC's**

The Machine Control Unit in a CNC machine is a system composed of a Bus that gathers the memory (ROM, RAM), the CPU, the IO interface (Panel, Tape Reader), the machine tool controls (Position, Spindle Speed) and the sequence control (Coolant, Fixture Clamping, Tool Changer).

A Direct Numerical Control system (DNC) controls multiple machine tools using a single mainframe computer through a direct connection to the tools in real time, it's 1960s technology that uses bidirectional communication. A Distributed Numerical Control (DNC) system controls multiple machine tools with Machine Control Units (CNC), it is the current technology that uses two way communication.

Configuration of a Direct Numerical Control system involves the connection to the MCU behind the tape reader (BTR), in a Distributed Numerical Control configuration entire programs are downloaded to each MCU. The network configuration can be of a Switching Network or a Local Area Network (1000 CNC from a Single Source).

![General DNC Configuration](/static/images/notes/IntegracionGeneralDNCConfiguration.png)

Additional properties of CNC Machines against NC Machines:

1. Storage of more than one part program
2. Various forms of program input
3. Program editing at the machine tool
4. Fixed cycles and programming subroutines
5. Interpolation
6. Acceleration and deceleration computations
7. Communications interface
8. Diagnostics

**NC Positioning System**

The Positioning System for a CNC machine has multiple configurations including a motor and leadscrew (one linear axis), ball lead screw, ball screw nut or acme lead screw nut.

* Ball Screw: Rounded teeth for the balls in the nut to circulate with little backlash, used in high thrust loads (large payloads and forces), they have low friction, high duty cycle, low wear and high efficiency (70-90 percent). However, they are noisy, expensive and their weight can cause slippage or back driving for vertical operations.
* Acme Screw: Flat teeth with a simple screw and nut configuration that uses a wedge to drive the nut, they have low cost, low noise, low vibration and resistance to slippage. However, they are hotter, have high wear, high friction and backlash that decrease the efficiency (30 percent).
* Roller Screw Nuts: Used for high loads with recirculating roller system instead of balls. Used for high loads (high surface contact) with low wear. Highest cost from precision manufacturing, complex assembly and a larger installation footprint.
* Planetary Roller: Higher contact point with a higher load capacity, improved stiffness, higher operating lifespan (inches of travel) and an overall higher linear and rotational speed.

![NC Positioning Systems](/static/images/notes/IntegracionScrewsPositioningCNCMach.png)

Positioning NC Systems can be further subdivided into:

1. Open-loop: No feedback to verify that the actual position achieved is the desired position, we trust in the accuracy of the stepper motor (Full Step or Half Step sequence).
2. Closed-loop: Uses feedback measurements like incremental optical encoders (DAC and Comparator) to confirm that the final position is the specified position.

**Motion Control Systems**

1. Point to Point Systems or position systems that move to a location and perform an operation, used in most robotic fields.
2. Continuous Path Systems or contouring machining systems that perform an operation while moving.

**Velocity Profiles**

The simplest velocity profile is a Trapezoidal motion profile where it accelerates and deaccelerates at a constant magnitude until it reaches the desired speed. A better approach is using with an S-Curve motion profile that provides a smooth motion that reduces abrupt acceleration changes and jerking, it does this by implementing an interpolation method:

1. Linear Interpolation: Creates a straight line between two points in space.
2. Circular Interpolation: Circular arc defined by a starting point, end point, radius and direction. Considered an approximation from multiple linear interpolations where the tolerance is defined for the inside-outside of the nominal curve. 
3. Helical Interpolation: Circular plus linear motion. Considered a linear interpolation on the Z axis followed by a 2 axis circular interpolation on the X and Y axis. It can be used to start milling a cavity (pocket box) or as an alternative to drilling.
4. Parabolic and Cubic Interpolation: Free form curves that use higher order equations. Considered complex curve models such as Bezier, Splines or NURBS (parametric curve).

Precision in NC Position is done through:

1. Control Resolution: Distance that separates two adjacent addressable points in the axis (given the motor precision and the screw pitch).
2. Accuracy: Maximum possible error between the desired target (addressable point) and the actual position.
3. Repeatability: Mechanical error (3 sigma) distribution associated with the axis.

![CNC Interpolation](/static/images/notes/IntegracionInterpolationCNC.png)

**NC Part Programming**

* Absolute Positioning: Locations defined relative to the origin of the axis system. Note that if the G Code only specifies one absolute coordinate the rest will remain relative.
* Incremental Positioning: Locations defined relative to the current position.

**G Code Steps**

* Modal Code: Looping processes that starts with a code and continues until explicitly stopped by another command.
* Climb Milling: Generally used for surface finish cuts on a manual milling machine (0.01 to 0.02 in) since chips are evacuated behind the cut. It's used for all cuts on a CNC milling machine.
* Conventional Milling: Generally used for all cuts on a manual milling machine since it pushes against the backlash in the lead screw. Usually better when machining hard materials at the cost of a lower quality surface.
* Machining Cycles: Include Pocket Milling, Contour Turning, External Threading and Facing (Shoulder Facing).
* Note that the R Code (Arc Radius) can only be used for arcs that are less than 360 degrees. Therefore minus R codes produce a circle with a longer arc.

**Industrial Robotics**

A robot is a general purpose programmable machine with certain anthropomorphic characteristics. Their advantages include:

1. Can substitute humans in hazardous work environments.
2. Consistency and Accuracy not attainable by humans.
3. Can be easily reprogrammed.
4. Can be interfaced to other computer systems.

Applications include arc welding, soldering, spot welding, machine tending, picking, packing, palletizing, assembly, gluing, adhesive sealing, spraying, waterjet, cutting and inspection.

A robot manipulator as a mechanism consists of joints and links that form a Body-Arm section (object positioning in the workspace) and a Wrist assembly section (object orientation). The workspace, workvolume o working envelope is the reach of the robot in 3D space given its kinematics.

* Joints provide relative motion and can be linear (Linear L or Orthogonal O) or rotary (Rotational R, Twisting T or Revolving V), each additional joint provides a degree of freedom DOF with most robots having 5 or 6.
* Links are the rigid members between joints.

![Joints Image](/static/images/notes/IntegracionJointTypes.png)

Joint Notation Scheme is a notation system to describe a manipulator using the joint symbols and a colon to separate the Body-Arm assembly from the Wrist assembly (TLR:TR). These are the most common Body-Arm assembly (position a tool or gripper in space) configurations:

1. Serial Kinematics: Sequence of links and joints
   1. Polar Coordinate: Also known as spherical it consists of a sliding arm (L) actuated relative to the body where the body can rotate in a vertical axis (T) and a horizontal axis (R).
   2. Cylindrical: With a TLO notation it consists of a vertical column (L) relative to which the arm is moved, the arm can move in or out of the column (O) and rotate around it (T).
   3. Cartesian Coordinate: Also known as rectilinear robot or XYZ robot, With a LOO notation it consists of three sliding joints, two of which are orthogonal. It can be found in an additional Gantry configuration.
   4. Jointed Arm: Similar configuration to a human arm with a base, shoulder, elbow and wrist. It has a TRR notation. Note that it has a big workspace with the only limitation being that the shoulder sometimes can't reach its back.
   5. Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA): With a VRO or TRRL notation it is similar to a jointed arm but with vertical axes used for the shoulder and elbow, in other words it excels at high speed vertical insertion tasks.
2. Parallel Kinematics: Links connected to the same starting and ending object.
   1. Delta: One of the fastest robots, similar to SCARA.
   2. Hexapod: 6/6 Stewart Platform, 3/6 Stewart Platform, Spatial Tetrad or Spatial Double Triad.

**Universal Robots Course**

* A universal robot arm consists of 6 axis, 360 degrees of rotation, a base, shoulder, elbow and three wrists. 
* To power the robot you use a control box (motherboard, SD Card, safety board). The SD contains linux and UR POLYSCOPE software.
  * Connection to safety devices (emergency stop, safeguard stop), peripherals and sensors.
* The teach pendant goes over the control box and it is where you program and configure the robot motion.
* Motion is defined as a series of waypoints and actions. On the top of the pendant is the manual control botton to change the robot position.
* When it detects a colission on its way to a waypoint it activates a Protective Stop.
* You can connect different End Effectors like a gripper that communicate with the robot, use the Installation IO Tab.
* The TCP tool center point, center of gravity and payload must be defined before any waypoint is excecuted.
* Motion can be linear (L), freely (J) or smooth (P). Smooth motion has a constant speed and its required for circular motion.
* A Thread is an independent subprocess to the main sequence of commands, Sync() tells the program that a Thread excecution is finished.
* Additional safety features include Tool Spheres and Points that define a safety boundary plane.
* Optimization involes smoothing of motion profiles at certain waypoints and additional acceleration.
* Features allow to set waypoints relative to a plane or point in space, they allow for flexible placement of the target.
* Machining operations often require to apply forces between waypoints, otherwise a preventive Stop will ocurr.

**Wrist and End Effector**

The end effector is attached to wrist assembly, the function of the wrist is to orient the end effector while the Body-Arm assembly determines its global position. The wrist can have two or three degrees of freedom in a Roll, Pitch or Yaw orientation. The end effector is a special robot tooling designed to perform a specific task:

1. Grippers: Grasp and manipulate objects during the work cycle.
   1. Two finger mechanical gripper, dual gripper, multiple fingered gripper, universal gripper.
2. Tools: Perform a process such as spot welding or spray painting.

The TCP or Tool Center Point is the point of reference that the Body-Arm and Wrist will use when calculating motion between points in space, generally defined as the distance between the robot flange and the end effector center or tip. Robot diagrams generally show dimensions, workspace, mounting configurations and load diagrams.

![Wrist and TCP](/static/images/notes/IntegracionWristandTCP.png)

**Installation and Dynamic Properties**

* Installation: Supply voltage (200-600V), rated power (4.5 kVA), mounting, ambient temperature (5 - 45C), washing conditions (high pressure steam), clean room (class 10 or 4), operating noise (70dB), emission (EMC and EMI shields), safety features (double circuits, emergency stops, etc).
* Application: Handling capacity (5kg), reach of 5th axis (810mm), supplementary load on upper arm (1kg), supplementary load on wrist (0.5kg). Axis degrees of rotation (working range), max TCP velocity, max TCP acceleration, axis max velocity (degrees per second), dimensions, weight, degree of shielding.

A robot's motion has four dynamic properties:

1. Precision: Capacity of the system to repeatedly return a tool from one well defined target in space.
2. Accuracy: How close to the real target is the final position.
3. Repeatibility: Precision after turning the robot on and off.
   1. As defined by ISO 9283 it is the ability of the robot to achieve the same target multiple times. 
   2. Can be measured at five points in the largest cube inscribed in its workspace.
   3. ISO testing for repeatibility requires advanced measuring equipments (laser tracker).
   4. TriCal is an alternative tool to measure repeatibility at a lower cost.
4. Spatial resolution: Spherical volume that contains the variance points of the end effector after moving the robot multiple times with the same Loading Conditions.

**Joint Speed Reducers**

One of the main problems with modern robotics is the size of the joints that need to accomodate an actuator, controler, sensors and speed reducers in a small volume (DLR or LWR2). Seven DOF experimental robots achieve the smallest joint volume. One of the most important parts of the joints are the speed reducers:

1. Pulley and belt: Low cost and assembly time but less accurate and prone to stifness after a certain period of time.
2. Gear Train: High assembly time and cost.
3. Worm and Helical Gears: High assembly time and cost.
4. Planetary Gear: High assembly time and cost. High torque capacity and stifness.
5. Strain Wave Gear (Harmonic Drive): Almost no backlash and a higher operating life but expensive to manufacture. Consists of a wave generator, flex spline and circular spline.
6. Cycloid: Consists of fixed ring pins, roller pins, eccentric shaft, bearings and a cycloidal disc, they are cheaper than Harmonic Drives while also minimizing backlash.

A modern joint example is the Powerball Lightweight Arm for LWA 4P by SCHUNK Mobile ERB, containing a control system, encoder, driver, harmonic drive, holding brake and hollow shaft in a small volume.

![Joint Speed Gears](/static/images/notes/IntegracionJointSpeedReducers.png)


**Robot Control Systems**

1. Limited Sequence: Pick and place operations using mechanical stops at set points.
2. Playback with Point to Point: Records the work cycle as a sequence of points, plays the sequence during execution.
3. Playback with Continuous Path: Great memory capacity and interpolation when executing motion.
4. Intelligent Control: Behavior that seems intelligent, various responses to sensor inputs, decisions and human communication.

The forward kinematics problem is the method of determining the coordinates and orientations of the robot's end effector if the angles of the joints (encoders) and the links dimesions are known. The inverse kinematic problem is the method of determining the values of the joint angles for a desired target.

The robot singularity happens since there are multiple solutions to the inverse kinematics problem (joint axis align), their only differentiator being the final orientation to the target, considering this orientation the inverse kinematic problem can be solved using the systematic Denavit-Hartenberg procedure.

![Wrist and TCP](/static/images/notes/IntegracionRobotSingularity.png)

**Robot Orientation**

There are multiple ways of describing orientation in 3D space including:

* Roll, Pitch and Yaw angles (aviation).
* Rotation matrices.
* Euler Angles (12).
* Euler Angles Z-X'-Z''.
* Axis-Angle.
* Quaternions (Euler-Rodrigues).

Euler angles are the most common rotational coordinates, they are the result of three consecutive rotations about three axes. The Z-X'-Z'' representation is the most basic one, initially implemented for gyroscopes, the X-Y'-Z'' representation was later developed as the Bryant Angles variant.

![Orientation Space](/static/images/notes/Integracion3DOrientationSpace.png)

The Axis Angle representation uses a vector and a scalar, the vector can be any axis relative to the absolute coordinate system and the scalar is the angle of rotation. Quaternions are an extension of complex numbers with two additional imaginary dimensions that represent each axial rotation.

**Material Handling**

![Material Handling Production](/static/images/notes/IntegracionMaterialHandlingProductionSystem.png)

* Material Transport Systems: Movement, storage, protection and control of materials throughout the manufacturing and distribution process including their consumption and disposal (MHIA). Materials must be handled safely, efficiently, at low cost, in a timely manner (just in time), without damage and accurately (right materials to the right locations).

	13. Used unit loads to handle multiple items simultaneously.
	14. To reduce the number of trips done and the loading-unloading times.
	15. To decrease the damage risk from multiple handling operations.
	16. Unit load containers include wooden pallets, pallet boxes and tote boxes (stackable).

![Material Handling Analysis](/static/images/notes/IntegracionImportantMaterialHandlingAnalysis.png)

**Storage Systems**

![Storage and Retrieval Methods](/static/images/notes/IntegracionVariousStorageandRetrievalMethods.png)

1. Storage Location Strategies
   1. Storage and Retrieval Systems: Store materials for a period of time and permit retrival when required. Used in factories, warehouses, distribution centers, wholesale dealerships and retail stores. Important supply chain component that can incorporate automation.
   2. Storage Location Strategies can be Randomized (Incoming items stored on the nearest available location) or Dedicated (Incoming items assigned to specific locations). Dedicated locations can be designated based on a simple number sequence, the activity level (popularity) or the activity to space ratio. Randomized storage uses less overall space but retrieval strategies are more complex.
   3. The inventory level oscillates as a function of time based on the order quantity, the depletion rate and the safety stock level (minimum level). In a dedicated storage strategy the minimum number of storage locations required will be the maximum inventory level times the number of products, in a randomized strategy the number of locations will be the average inventory level times the number of products.
   4. Dedicated storage based on activity will generally have higher throughput rates while a randomizes storage will generally use less total space. The combination of both strategies is a hybrid Class-Based dedicated storage where the most active items (based on their activity level class) are located near the input-output points, its randomized as you can store multiple products in a random order if they share their class.
2. Storage System Performance
   1. Storage Capacity: Measured as the total volumetric space used and the total number of unit loads (storage compartments) used.
   2. Storage Density: Volumetric space available for storage relative to the total space in the facility.
   3. Accessibility: Capacity to access any item in storage.
   4. System Throughput: Hourly rate of storage and retrieval operations.
   5. Reliability: Utilization and availability of the system machinery.
3. Conventional Storage Methods and Equipment
   1. Bulk Storage (Blocks): Storage in an open floor area, simple but has problems balancing its high density with accessibility. To improve accessibility additional rows between blocks are needed.
   2. Rack Systems: Racks used to storage pallet loads, allows for greater vertical stacking.
   3. Shelving and bins: Horizontal platforms in structural frames (standard sizes), used for small items. High density but hard to find items (low accessibility).
   4. Drawer Storage: Similar to shelving but easier to find items since the entire content of the drawer is visible.
4. Automated Storage Systems
   1. Mechanized and automated storage reduces human resources but at a significant initial investment. There are multiple levels of automation with mechanized systems (operator participates in each storage-retrieval) or fully automated (loads are entered or retrieved under computer control). You can automate the retrieval of items, their transportation to a processing or interface point and their storage.
   2. Compact FILO (First in Last Out): As unit loads come in they are the last to leave.
   3. Dynamic FIFO (First in First Out): As unit loads come in they are the first to leave.
   4. Mobile (Moving Racks in Guides): Entire racks move to their desired location.
   5. Automatic (Robotic-Automated Storage-Retrieval System): In this AS-RS system racks have automated cranes that execute the storage-retrieval of loads by traveling inside aisles.
      1. Applications include unit load storage and retrieval in warehousing or distribution (Unit Load, Deep Lane), order picking (Miniload, Man-On-Board, Item Retrieval) and Work-In-Process storage (Manage WIP, buffer storage, JIT strategy). 
      2. Unit load AS-RS: Uses a simple S-R machine, a rack storage structure and pallet loads storage modules.
      3. Deep-Lane AS-RS: Uses flow through racks and fewer access aisles. Can be adapted in a FIFO or FILO configuration. Used in the food industry.
      4. Miniload AS-RS: Handles small loads in bins or drawers to perform an order picking of various items.
      5. Man-On-Board AS-RS: The automated carriage transports a human to the item for manual retrieval and storage.
      6. Item Retrieval: Fully automated rack system that picks individual items and outputs them to a station (Goods-To Operator). Can be considered an hybrid since manual storage is possible.
      7. Vertical Lift Storage Modules (VLSM): Similar to a Unit Load but uses vertical aisles instead of horizontal aisles.
   6. Rotative (Carousel System): In this system an oval conveyor has bins to contain individual items. 
      1. Applications include storage and retrieval (order picking, kitting parts for assembly), transport and accumulation (stations located around carousel), Work-In-Progress (assembly storage in electronics industry) and others (time testing of electrical products).
      2. Horizontal: Similar to an overhead conveyor, items are stored in bins suspended from a 3-30 m conveyor. This is the most common type.
      3. Vertical: Uses a vertical conveyor loop with less floor space required but an overhead room must be constructed.
5. Benefits of AS-RS systems
   1. Recover Factory Floor Space: Factory space currently used for WIP, raw stock or finished parts is more efficient with AS-RS, releasing it for manufacturing instead.
   2. Increase Storage Capacity and Density: To create better long-range storage plans.
   3. Improve Inventory Management and Control.
   4. Quicker response time locating, storing and retrieving items.
   5. Reduce inventory shortages due to real time information and control (tracking).
   6. Reduce labor costs due to automation, increase productivity and throughput.
   7. Improved stock rotation.
   8. Improved security and reduced pilferage from the closed area.
   9. Flexibility in design for a wide variety of loads.
   10. Interfacing with AGV's, FMS and other inspection systems like Coordinate Measurement.
   11. Reduced scrap and rework from better part handling.
   12. Reduced operating expenses in light, power and heat.
   13. Compatible with a JIT strategy implementation from accurate and automatic S-R of items.

**Automatic Identification and Data Capture**

![Images Codes Bar Types](/static/images/notes/IntegracionBarCodesTypes.png)

1. Overview of AIDC methods
   1. AIDC Definition: Technologies that provide direct entry of data into a controller, processor or computer without using a keyboard. Advantages against manual collection and data entry include better data accuracy (No human errors), timeliness (no time factor delays) and labor reduction (reduced cost for the worker's full attention).
   2. Applications: Used in retail sales, inventory control, material handling (shipping, receiving, storing, picking, parcel handling), factory operations (orders, WIP tracking, machine utilization, worker attendance) and other (patient ID, bank check processing, security systems).
   3. Components: Data encoding (alphanumeric chars into machine readable form), Machine Scanning (scanner reads encoded data and converts it into a useful electrical signal) and Data Decoding (signal is transformed into digital data and back into chars).
   4. Technology: The AIDC method can be optical based (bar codes, optical character recognition, machine vision), electromagnetic based (radio frequency identification) or magnetic based (magnetically encoded into a tape).
2. Linear Bar Code Technology (data read using a linear sweep)
   1. Linear Bar Codes: Can be width-modulated (bars and spaces of varying width - Universal Product Code) or height-modulated (bars and spaces of varying height - US Postal Service ZIP). The EAN (European Article Number) and JAN (Japan Article Number) are compatible with the UPC. The UPC code consists of a country code (2) a manufacturer code (5) a product item code (5) and a check digit code (1). There are hundreds of bar code variations.
   2. Bar Code Components: Quiet zone (margin) 10 times as narrow width, Start-Stop Char, Data (message), Check digit (read error), length, height (as high as possible at least 15 percent the length).
   3. Code 39 (AIAG Label): Linear code developed in 1975 for the automotive and electronics industry with 43 characters by the AIAG in USA. Each character is represented by 9 spaces and bars. The start-stop character is an asterisk. The inter-char gap width is as wide as the narrow bar width (max width is 3-5.3 times wider than narrow bar). For example a full label would contain the part number code (P), the quantity in the container (Q), the supplier code (V) and the serial number code (S).
   4. Morse Bar Code: They have difficulties since only the dark bars are used and the number of bars making each char differs making decoding difficult.
   5. Linear Bar Code Readers: Can be contact (hand held or light pens) or contactless (readers focus light beam and photodetector reads the reflected signal). Non-Contact readers can produce a fixed beam (stationary readers) or a moving beam (lasers with angular sweep). In the industry linear bar code readers can be used to generate a Bar-Coded Route Sheet of a product assembly line. 
3. Two-Dimensional Bar Code Technology (data is read in both directions)
   1. Introduced in 1987 can be stacked (multiple rows of conventional codes such as PDF417) or in matrix (2D patterns of cells such as QR Code). Their main advantage is the capability to contain more data.
   2. When compared to linear barcodes they can be read both horizontally and vertically (barcodes in a single line), they have an additional dimension for information (barcodes limited data), the additional information can contain the origin, repairs and product's condition (barcodes information limited to number and location) but 2D scanners used to be more expensive (barcode scanners are cheaper).
4. Radio Frequency Identification RFID
   1. Usage of an identification Tag with an electronically encoded data attached to the item. The tag has a microchip and an antenna in a plastic container acting as a transponder capable of emitting a signal as it receives a signal from an external source. Communication is done through RF encoded data when a low magnetic field by the reader activates the tag.
   2. RFID represent the best competitor to bar codes, big retailer companies are mandating suppliers to use RFID tags since they can make replenishing out-of-stock items 63 percent more efficient.
   3. They can be classified into passive tags (no internal power source, power from reader, smaller, less expensive, longer lasting) or active tags (own battery, larger memory capacity and communication range, higher cost, expensive items).
   4. Applications: In the industry they help with inventory management, supply chain management, tracking, warehouse control, location identification and WIP items.
   5. Advantages include that identification doesn't depend on contact or direct line of sight, they have larger memories for larger information storage, data can be altered for historical usage or reusability. The main disadvantage is that its more expensive than other AIDC technology.
5. Comparison of Bar Codes and RFID:
   1. Bar Codes use optical technology, are read only, can store 14-16 digits in a linear memory, require a line of sight, have no reusability with a one time use, are susceptible to dirt and scratches but have a very low cost per label.
   2. RFID use radio frequency technology, are read and write, can store 96-256 digits in memory, don't require a line of sight, are reusable, more durable in a plant environment but are 10 times more expensive than a bar code.
6. Other AIDC
   1. Other AIDC technology includes Magnetic Stripes (Credit cards and money access, expensive, must contact scanner for reading), Optical Character Recognition (OCR can be read by humans and machines, low first read rate) and Machine Vision (Mostly for inspection and used with 2D Optical Symbols).

**PLC**

IMAGEN DE PARTES DE PLC

1. Introduction to PLC: Programmable Logic Controller is a miniature industrial grade computer with hardware and software capable of being programmed to perform industrial control functions. Used in manufacturing, process plants, machining, packaging, automated plants, etc. Can be in Modular Configuration (Plug and Play) or in Fixed Configuration.
2. Alternatives to PLC: Relay control systems are complex, costly, hardwired, logistically difficult, hard to troubleshoot, have a strict maintenance routine, are hard to modify, etc. PLC was designed to replace sequential relay circuits. It works by looking at its inputs and depending on their state turning on-off its outputs.
3. Advantages of PLC
	1. Reprogrammable: Easy and fast to make changes
	2. Solid State Switches: Last much longer than relays (electromechanical parts) or electronic bulbs.
	3. Complex Logic: Can be represented by software.
	4. Embedded: Multiple devices into one unit.
	5. Scalable: Can be scaled up or modified on the fly.
	6. Duplication: Applications can be repeated faster and at a low cost.
	7. Smaller Size: Has a smaller physical size than other hard wired solutions.
	8. Integrated Diagnostics: Troubleshooting is easier and faster.
	9.  Documentation: Applications can be immediately documented after implementation.
	10. Maintenance: There is less downtime due to less frequent maintenance.
	11. Sturdy: They can withstand severe environmental conditions.
	12. Sophisticated Controls: Computational power makes possible to build complex control (PID's, Predictive, MPC).
4. Disadvantages of PLC: Closed Architecture: Most manufacturers offer proprietary, closed code devices. This makes interoperability between manufacturers imposible limiting design and cost options. Also proprietary hardware inherently has a higher setup and training costs.
5. PLC: Designed for extreme industrial environments, high temperature and humidity, immunity to noise, proprietary command interpreter, no secondary memory, optimized for a single task. PC: Data processing and calculation, not build for harsh environments, can be programmed in many languages with ample memory and optimized for speed and multitasking.
6.  Parts of a PLC 10 a 22
	1. Power Supply: Provides internal DC voltages to the system components, regulates and monitores supplied voltajes warning the CPU if outside rated range, supplies well regulated power and protection for the components. Input from AC 120 VAC or 220 VAC some accept DC 24 VDC. Has tolerances of 10 to 15 percent of variation due to power fluctuations. Dimensioning is determining how many modules are required and then computing the total current requirements, a table that lists module types, current requirements and available power supplies.
	2. Input-Output Modules (Discrete-Digital and Analog): They have LED status indicators, input connections, power supply connections and output connections. Other types of output modules are PID Modules, BCD-ASCII Modules, Stepper Motor Control, Encoder Counter, High Speed Counters and Motion-Position control.
		1. Discrete Modules: Digital inputs and outputs that sense (signal received from a device), convert (input to correct voltage), isolate (fluctuations in the input's signal) and send a signal (processor to indicate which sensor is responsible). Inputs (switches, limit switches, push buttons) and outputs (relays, solenoids, lamps) are  discrete devices.
		2. Analog Modules: Continuously Changing signals, Precise control of the process, representing physical quantities with an infinite number of values. Inputs-Outputs typically vary from 0 to 20 mA or 0 to 10 V. Variables represented include temperature, pressure, humidity, density and fluid level.
	3. Communication Interface (HMI Status-HMI Programming): Used to establish point to point connections with other devices such as PC's, PLC's and HMI's. They stablish high speed networks that may be different from the communication network provided with the PLC.
	4. Processor Module: Battery for backup power, memory module, hardware address, keyswitch, channel 1 ethernet (10Base-T) and channel 0 RS232 (DH485, DF1, ASCII). Either modular or built-in into the PLC system with varying processing speed and memory. The processor is made for high speed control operations and not general purpose computing.
		1. The CPU executes the operating system, manages memory, monitors inputs, provides the means for connecting to external device, provide system diagnostics with status indicators and may have a mode selection switch (RUN, PROG, REM).
		2. RUN runs the ladder program and energizes output devices, prevents online editing or programmer usage of the device interface. PROG enables program entry and editing, preventing the CPU from scanning or executing, controller outputs are deenergized and it prevents from using a programmer interface devices to change the mode. REM puts the CPU in remote mode, either Remote RUN, Remote Program or Remote Test, it allows for processor mode change and perform online program editing. 
7.  PLC in Operation
	17. The processor CPU is the brain of the PLC, it implements the logic and controlling the module communications. Stores program information and logical operations results in memory (EPROM or EEPROM with RAM). It controls all activity and enables user to enter the desired program in ladder logic.
	18. The program is executed as a repetitive process called SCAN. A typical scan involves: reading the input status (written to the input image table file or register), executing the application (Resulting logic is written to the output image table), update output status (Transfer output image data into external output circuits), perform internal diagnostic and communications (internal checks on memory, speed and operation), repeat process as long as PLC is in RUN mode.
8.  Ladder Logic 25 a 45
	19. 
9.  Programming PLC
	20. The system to be controlled is described in ladder logic.
	21. Ladder logic is compilded and translated into basic instructions that are uploeaded to memory.
	22. The programing is down while set to TERMINAL or PROGRAMMING MODE.
	23. Programming can be donde through a PLC programmer or PC with software.
	24. Programming languages for PLC from IEC 61131-3 Standard are: Instruction Lists, Structured Text, Ladder Diagrams and Function Block Diagrams.
10. Troubleshooting and Maintenance
	25. Ground yourself before handling static sensitive components.
	26. Wear a wrist strap to a path that can bleed off any charge build up.
	27. Be careful not to touch the backplane connector of the PLC system (handle circuit cards by the edges if possible).
	28. Don't touch other circuit components when configuring or replacing internal components.
	29. When not in use store the modules in a static shield bag, if available use a static safe work station.
