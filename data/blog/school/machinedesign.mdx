Analyze, select, design and simulate the fundamental elements that make up a machine, establish operation loads and stresses on different components considering safety factors. 

***

**Machine Design Introduction**

* Gears: Fundamental component of high durability when lubricated and within their capacity range, there are many types and can be found inside power transmissions.
* Belts: Alternate way of power transmission, less durable but don't have to be as lubricated as gears, their main advantage is the unlimited distance between the shafts.
* Roller Chains: With their sprockets they can have one or more strands, they have a very high durability when lubricated. Used in conveyor belts or critical engine points.
* Cables: Used in elevators, parking brakes (to give a yank to the brake pads) and even the gear lever when using a rigid cable to interact with the transmission.
* Bearings: Used to reduce friction on the shaft after the power has been transmitted. 
* Shafts: They can be quite complex since they need steps for the breaks or bearings. They are designed by taking into account expected vibrations, stress, fatigue etc.

***

**Types of Gears**

* Spur gears are cheap but noisy, they only work when the teeth are parallel to the shaft.
* Helical gears are more expensive than spur gears but they are less noisy from their gradual teeth engagement. Their teeth are inclined to the axis of rotation.
* Bevel gears are used when you the input and output shafts are perpendicular to each other.
* Worm gears have power loss from friction but achieve the greatest power per volume. Used when the speed ratio between shafts is high.

**Nomenclature**

* Number of Teeth ($N$): Number of teeth on a given gear.
* Pitch Circle: Theoretical circle upon which all calculations are based. The pitch circles of a pair of mating gears are tangent to each other.
* Pitch Diameter ($d$): Diameter of the pitch circle.
* Center Distance ($c$): Average between both pitch diameters.
* Circular Pitch ($p$): Distance on the pitch circle from a point on one tooth to the corresponding point of another. It is equal to the sum of the tooth thickness and the width of space.
* Pinion: The smaller of two mating gears, with the larger simply called *the gear*.
* Module ($m$): Ratio between the pitch diameter to the number of teeth in millimeters. In terms of SI units its the index of the tooth size.
* Diametral Pitch ($P$): Ratio between the number of teeth to the pitch diameter in teeth per inch. Reciprocal of the module.
* Addendum a: Radial distance between the top land and the pitch circle.
* Dedendum b: Radial distance between the bottom land and the pitch circle.
* Whole Depth ($h_t$): Sum of the addendum and dedendum.
* Clearance Circle: Circle tangent to the addendum circle of the mating gear.
* Clearance ($c$): Difference in the dedendum of a given gear to the addendum of its mating gear.
* Backlash ($B$): Difference on the pitch circle of the width of a tooth space to the thickness of the engaging tooth.

Imagine that we have gears of perfect form, surface and they are perfectly rigid. We want that two pair of teeths that are in contact to have.

Conjugate accion: Design of teeth form and point of contact in order to have a constant angular velocity ratio.
Possible to select eny tooth form and find another that will generate conjugate action, one of this profiles is the INVOLUTE PROFILE for both teeth.

If one CURVED surface pushes agains another the point of contact (c) will be tangent to each other.
Forces at any instant will be directed along the common normal AB to the two curves.
The line AB represents the direction of forces action so it is the LINE OF ACTION.
The line of action intersects the line of centers at some point P.
Therefore the constant angular velocity will be proportional to their RADII AND POINT P.
In this case the PITCH CIRCLE is the circle that goes trough point P from each of the surfaces centers. And the PITCH POINT will be the point P.

If gear involute curves are used then they will tolerate changes in CENTER TO CENTER distance with no angular velocity radio variations. 
The TRICK is keeping the Pitch Point Fixed if we cant constant angular velocity ratio, in other words every line of action must pass through P for every point of contact C.

This is the case of gears with involute profiles.

Involute curves can be generated by extending the circunference with a tangent line.


Cord wrapped around A
Point b of the cord is the tracing point.
As cord is wrapped point b will trace curve AC
Radius of curvature varies continously with cero at a and maximum at c.
point b will be equal to the distance BE since b is continously rotating about point e.
Line DE is normal to the involute at all intersection points and always tangent to cylinder.
The circle that the involute is based on is the base circle

The common face width ($F$) is 3 to 5 times the circular pitch. The involute used to create the shape of the teeth is designed to minimize the manufacturing costs while maximizing the stability of the angular velocity between the gears. It achieves this by knowing that the angular velocity between two cams is directly related to their radii (conjugate action), therefore to keep their angular velocity constant their radii and the pressure angle between them also need to be kept constant.

**Line of Action**

A constant pressure line (line of action) will trace a contact line that starts at $a$ and ends at $b$ (base circle of itself or addendum of the other). The middle point of this line is called the Pitch Point since it coincides with the pitch circle. Common pressure are between 20° and 25°, the old pressure angle was 14.5°. From the gear circle layout we can see that:

1. The pitch circles are in contact.
2. The pressure line is kept at the desired pressure angle.
3. The base circles are tangent to the pressure line.
4. The involute starts at the base circle.
5. The top of the teeth happens at the addendum or $1/P$ from the pitch circle.
6. The root of the teeth happens at the dedendum or $1.25/P$ from the pitch circle.
7. The tooth spacing at the circular pitch is $p = \pi / P$.
8. The angle of action is the sum of the angle of approach and recess.
9. The base circle relates to the pitch circle as $r_b = (r)(\cos(\Phi))$.

For example, suppose that a gearset has a 16 tooth pinion driving a 40 tooth gear, the diametral pitch is 2 in, the pressure angle is 20° and the addendum and dedendum have standard sizes. Calculate the circular pitch ($p$), center distance ($c$) and radii of the base circles ($r_p$ and $r_G$). If the center distance was 0.25 in larger than anticipated, calculate the new pressure angle and pitch circle diameters.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = 2\\
	p = \frac{\pi}{2} = 1.571 \, \text{in}\\
	d_p = \frac{N}{P} = \frac{16}{2} = 8\, \text{in}\\
	d_G = \frac{N}{P} = \frac{40}{2} = 20\, \text{in}\\
	c = \frac{d_p + d_G}{2} = \frac{8 + 20}{2} = 14\, \text{in}\\
	r_p = \frac{8}{2} \cos(20) = 3.759\, \text{in}\\
	r_G = \frac{20}{2} \cos(20) = 9.397\, \text{in}\\
	c' = \frac{d_p' + d_G'}{2} = 14.25\\
	\frac{d_p'}{d_G'} = \frac{16}{40}\\
	d_p' = 8.143\, \text{in} \quad d_G' = 30.357\,\text{in}\\
	\Phi' = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_p}{d_p' / 2}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_G}{d_G' / 2}\right) = 22.59°
\end{gathered}
$$

A rack is a type of spur gear with an infinite pitch diameter $d$, in this case the involute for the rack is a straight line at sides of the teeth, the base pitch relates to the circular pitch as $p_b = p_c(\cos(\Phi))$.

**Contact Ratio**

The arc of action ($q_t$) is the sum of the arc of approach ($q_a$) and the arc of recess ($q_r$), that is $q_t = q_a + q_r$. The contact ratio ($m_c$) is the ratio between the arc of action and the circular pitch $m_c = \frac{q_t}{p}$, it represents the average number of teeth pairs that are in contact. It can also be found from the length of the line of action:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	m_c = \frac{L_{ab}}{p(\cos(\Phi))} = \frac{q_t}{p}
\end{gathered}
$$

For most applications the contact ratio should be 1.2 or more. This ensures that there will always be at least one tooth in contact and possibly two at any given time, however when designing a machine we will always consider that ideally only one tooth is in contact.


![Gear Contact Ratio](/static/images/notes/MachineDesContactRatio.png)

**Interference**

![Gear Contact Ratio](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesInterference.png)

Interference is the contact of tooth profiles that aren't conjugate, generally when there is contact below the base circle. The smallest number of teeth for a one to one spur gear without interference is: 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k}{3\sin^2(\Phi)} (1 + \sqrt{1+3\sin^2(\Phi))}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that $k=1$ for full depth teeth and $k=0.8$ for stub teeth. In a spur with a larger gear ratio ($m_G =\frac{N_G}{N_P}$) the smallest number of teeth without interference will be:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k}{(1+2m)\sin^2(\Phi)} (m + \sqrt{m^2+(1+2m)\sin^2(\Phi)})
\end{gathered}
$$

The largest gear teeth number for a specified pinion size without interference is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_G = \frac{N_P^2 \sin^2(\Phi)-4k^2}{4k-2N_P\sin^2(\Phi)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Finally the smallest spur pinion teeth number with a rack and without interference is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k}{\sin^2(\Phi)}
\end{gathered}
$$

| Minimum $N_P$ (20°) | Maximum $N_G$ | Integer Max $N_G$ | Max Gear Ratio $m_G$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 13 | 16.45 | 16 | 1.23 |
| 14 | 26.12 | 26 | 1.86 |
| 15 | 45.49 | 45 | 3 |
| 16 | 101.07 | 101 | 6.31 |
| 17 | 1309.86 | 1309 | 77 |

| Minimum $N_P$ (25°) | Maximum $N_G$ | Integer Max $N_G$ | Max Gear Ratio $m_G$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 9 | 13.33 | 13 | 1.44 |
| 10 | 32.39 | 32 | 3.2 |
| 11 | 249.23 | 249 | 22.64 |

Normally interference is eliminated by using more teeth on the pinion, however to preserve the diametral pitch there needs to be an increase in diameter. Another way to eliminate interference is by using a larger pressure angle, resulting in a smaller base circle but this is discouraged it increases the radial force for the same transmitted force.

**Forming of Gear Teeth**

The methods for forming gear teeth include: Sand casting, shell molding, investment casting, permanent mold casting, die casting, centrifugal casting, powder metallurgy, extrusion, cold forming and injection molding. Methods for cutting the gear teeth include: Milling, shaping and hobbing.

**Straight Bevel Gears**

![Bevel Gear Layout](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesBevelGearsDe.png)

They are used to transmit motion between intersecting shafts. Their pitch angles are related to their teeth as $\tan{\gamma} = \frac{N_P}{N_G}$ and $\tan{\Gamma} = \frac{N_G}{N_P}$. In this case the shape of the teeth is the same as in a spur gear of radius $r_b$ but projected on the back cone. The virtual number of teeth in this virtual spur gear is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N' = \frac{2\pi (r_b)}{p}
\end{gathered}
$$

| Tooth Proportions (Bevel) | Formula | 
| :---: | :---: |
| Working Depth | $h_k = \frac{2}{P}$ |
| Clearance | $c = \frac{0.188}{P} + 0.002$ | 
| Addendum of Gear | $a_G = \frac{0.54}{P} + \frac{0.460}{P(m_{90})^2}$ | 
| Gear Ratio | $m_G = \frac{N_G}{N_P}$ | 
| Equivalent 90 Ratio | $m_{90} = \sqrt{\frac{m_G \cos(\gamma)}{\cos(\Gamma)}}$ | 
| Face Width (Min) | $F = 0.3A_0$ or $F = \frac{10}{P}$ | 
| Minimum Teeth Pinion | 16, 15, 14, 13 | 
| Minimum Teeth Gear | 16, 17, 20, 30 | 

**Parallel Helical Gears**

Similar to spur gears but with a helix angle with respect to the gear centerline (involute helicoid), this adds an axial force to the shaft and the bearings. There is a smoother transition of force between the gears due to a gradual engagement. 

* Transverse Circular Pitch ($p_t$): Equivalent to the circular pitch in spur gears, it is located in the plane of rotation.
* Normal Circular Pitch ($p_n$): Circular pitch located in the plane perpendicular to the teeth.
* Axial Pitch ($p_x$): Along the direction of the shaft axis.
* Normal Diametral Pitch ($P_n$): Diametral pitch of the gear.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	p_n = p_t(\cos(\Psi))\\
	p_x = \frac{p_t}{\tan(\Psi)}\\
	P_n = \frac{P_t}{\cos(\Psi)}\\
	P_t = P_n (\cos(\Psi))\\
	p_n(P_n) = \pi\\
	\cos(\Psi) = \frac{\tan(\Phi_n)}{\tan(\Phi_t)}\\
	d = \frac{N}{p_n \cos(\Psi)}
	\cos(\Psi) = \frac{\tan{\Phi}}{\tan{\Phi}}
\end{gathered}
$$

The virtual number of teeth in this virtual spur gear is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N' = \frac{N}{\cos^3(\Psi)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Helical Gears Parallel](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesHellicalGearsParallel.png)

The smallest number of teeth for a one to one helical gear without interference is: 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k\cos(\Psi)}{3\sin^2(\Phi_t)} (1 + \sqrt{1+3\sin^2(\Phi_t))}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that $k=1$ for full depth teeth and $k=0.8$ for stub teeth. In a helical with a larger gear ratio ($m_G =\frac{N_G}{N_P}$) the smallest number of teeth without interference will be:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k\cos(\Psi)}{(1+2m)\sin^2(\Phi_t)} (m + \sqrt{m^2+(1+2m)\sin^2(\Phi_t)})
\end{gathered}
$$

The largest gear teeth number for a specified pinion size without interference is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_G = \frac{N_P^2 \sin^2(\Phi_t)-4k^2\cos^2(\Psi)}{4k\cos(\Psi)-2N_P\sin^2(\Phi_t)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Finally the smallest spur pinion teeth number with a rack and without interference is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_P = \frac{2k\cos(\Psi)}{\sin^2(\Phi_t)}
\end{gathered}
$$


| Quantity (Helical) | Formula | Quantity (in) | Formula |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Addendum | $\frac{1}{P_n}$ | External Center Distance | $\frac{D+d}{2}$ |
| Dedendum | $\frac{1.25}{P_n}$ | External Gear Outside (d) | $D+2a$ |
| Pinion Pitch Diameter | $\frac{N_p}{P_n (\cos(\Psi))}$ | External Pinion Outside (d) | $d+2a$ |
| Gear Pitch Diameter | $\frac{N_G}{P_n (\cos(\Psi))}$ | External Gear Root (d) | $D-2b$ |
| Normal Arc Thickness | $\frac{\pi}{2P_n} - \frac{B_n}{2}$ | External Pinion Root (d) | $d-2b$ |
| Pinion Base Diameter | $d (\cos(\Phi_t))$ | Internal Center Distance | $\frac{D-d}{2}$ |
| Gear Base Diameter | $D (\cos(\Phi_t))$ | Internal Inside (d) | $D-2a$ |
| Base Helix Angle | $\tan^{-1}(\tan(\Psi)\cos(\Phi_t))$ | Internal Root (d) | $D+2b$ |

For example, suppose a helical gear has a normal pressure angle of 20°, a helix angle of 25°, a transverse diametral pitch of 6 (teeth/in) and 18 teeth in total. Calculate the pitch diameter, the transverse, normal and axial pitches, the normal diametral pitch and the transverse pressure angle.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	d = \frac{N}{P_t} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \, \text{in}\\
	p_t = \frac{\pi}{P_t} = \frac{\pi}{6} = 0.5236 \, \text{in}\\
	p_n = p_t (\cos(\Psi)) = 0.5236 (\cos(25)) = 0.4745 \, \text{in}\\
	p_x = \frac{p_t}{\tan(\Psi)} = \frac{0.5236}{\tan(45)} = 1.123 \, \text{in}\\
	p_x = \frac{p_t}{\cos(\Psi)} = \frac{6}{\cos(25)} = 6.620 \, \text{teeth/in}\\
	\Phi_t = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\tan(\Phi_n)}{\cos(\Psi)} \right) = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\tan(20)}{\cos(25)} \right) = 21.88°
	
\end{gathered}
$$


**Worm Gears**

This is the only gear type where diameter, number of teeth and pitch are independent. Generally we specify a Lead Angle ($\lambda$), an axial pitch ($p_x$) for the Worm and a helix angle ($\Psi_G$) and a transverse circular pitch ($p_t$) for the gear. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	d_G = \frac{N_G p_t}{\pi}\\
	L = p_x N_w\\
	\tan(\lambda) = \frac{L}{\pi d_w}
\end{gathered}
$$

Worm gears can have any pitch diameter but it should be the same as the hob used to cut the gear teeth, based on this the recommended range for the pitch diameter as a function of the center distance is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{C^{0.875}}{3} \le d_W \le \frac{C^{0.875}}{1.7}
\end{gathered}
$$

The Lead in a screw is the distance it travels longitudinally from each turn and it applies when describing the worm gear. The face width of a worm gear ($F_G$) should be equal to the length of a tangent to the pitch circle and the addendum circle.

![Worms Gears](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesWormGearsWid.png)

| Lead Angle $\lambda$ (Worm) | Pressure Angle | Addendum | Dedendum |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0-15 | 14.5 | $0.3683p_x$ | $0.3683p_x$ |
| 15-30 | 20 | $0.3683p_x$ | $0.3683p_x$ |
| 30-35 | 25 | $0.2865p_x$ | $0.3314p_x$ |
| 35-40 | 25 | $0.2546p_x$ | $0.2947p_x$ |
| 40-45 | 30 | $0.2228p_x$ | $0.2578p_x$ |


**Crossed Helical System**

You can make perpendicular helical system however there will be an additional axial force that will be offset by a thrust bearing along the shaft. The system can be of right hand or left hand as the helix coincides with the thumb of the hand, we can also know the direction of the gear simply as the opposite force to the driver.

![Crossed Helical Gears](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesCrossedHelicalGear.png)

***

**Gear Trains**

If we consider the gear as a second pinion driving a third gear then the speed of the gear ($n_3$), in revolutions per minute, is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n_3 = \left| \frac{N_2}{N_3}  n_2 \right| = \left| \frac{d_2}{d_3} n_2 \right|
\end{gathered} 
$$

![Compound Gear Trains](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesCompoundGearT.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n_6 = -\frac{N_2}{N_3} \frac{N_3}{N_4} \frac{N_5}{N_6} n_2\\
	e = \pm \frac{\text{Driving Product}}{\text{Driven Product}}\\\\
	\text{Gear Train Equation}\\
	\boxed{n_L = (e)(n_F)}\\
\end{gathered} 
$$

Note that in the previous example the gear (3) is an idle gear meaning that it doesn't influence the angular velocity of gear (6). Idle gears are mainly used to change directions or to create some distance between two shafts.

Compound gear trains that have their input and output shafts (2 and 5) in line must satisfy a geometric condition:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{d_2}{2} + \frac{d_3}{2} = \frac{d_4}{2} + \frac{d_5}{2}\\
	P = \frac{N}{d}\\
	\frac{N_2}{(2P)} + \frac{N_3}{(2O)} = \frac{N_4}{(2P)} + \frac{N_5}{2P}\\
	N_2 + N_3 = N_4 + N_5
\end{gathered} 
$$

In general gear trains only have one degree of freedom since you only need to know the movement of the driver to determine the movement of the rest of the gears, a notable exception is planetary gears.

For example, consider the gear train in the next image, the shaft (a) rotates at 600 rev/min. Calculate the speed and direction of shaft (d):

![Example 17](/static/images/notes/MachineDesGearTrainExample.png)

1. Parallel helical gears must have the same helix angle.
2. Parallel helical gears must have opposite helix teeth (hand).
3. Crossed must have complementary 90° helix angles.
4. Crossed must have the same helix teeth (hand).
 
$$
\begin{gathered}
	n_2 = 600\\
	n_7 = (e)(n_2)\\
	e = \frac{N_2N_4N_6}{N_3N_5N_7} = \frac{(20)(8)(20)}{(40)(17)(60)} = 0.078\\
	n_7 = (0.078)(600) = 47.06\,\text{rpm}\\
	N_7 = \text{Clockwise Direction}
\end{gathered} 
$$

For example, consider the gear train in the next image, the mechanism drives gear (9) as pulley (2) rotates at 1200 rpm. Calculate the speed and direction of gear (9):

![Example 18](/static/images/notes/MachineDesGearTrainExample18.png)

1. When working with bands we use their diameter instead of their teeth number.
2. Note that generally even gears are drivers and odd gears are driven.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n_2 = 1200\\
	n_9 = (e)(n_2)\\
	\text{For Bands:}\\
	V = (r_1)(\omega_1) = (r_2)(\omega_2)\\
	\omega_2 = \frac{r_1}{r_2}\omega_1 = \frac{d_1}{d_2} \omega_2\\
	e = \frac{d_2 N_4 N_6 N_8}{d_3 N_5 N_7 N_9} = 0.0098\\
	n_9 = 0.0098(1200) = 11.76\, \text{rpm}\\
\end{gathered} 
$$

![Bands Velocity](/static/images/notes/MachineDesBandVelocities.png)

***

**Force Analysis of Spur**

The transmitted load ($W_t$) is defined as the tangential load of the gear ($W_t = F^t_{32}$), this is because the rest of the forces coincide with the moment center (zero), meaning that this tangential load is the component responsible for transmitting the torque: $T = \frac{d (W_t)}{2}$.

![Radial and Tangential Force](/static/images/notes/MachinesDesRadialAndTangentialForce.png)

The transmitted power $H$ from the tangential load is defined as $H = T(\omega) = (W_t \frac{d}{2})\omega$. Pitch line velocity or the linear velocity at the pitch circle is defined (in ft/min) as $V = \frac{\pi (d)(n)}{12}$ with diameter in inches and speed in rpm.

The relation between Power, Transmitted Load and Pitch Velocity is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{US Units}\\
	W_t \,\text{lbf} = \frac{33000 H \,\text{hp}}{V \,\text{ft/min}}\\
	\text{SI Units}\\
	W_t \,\text{kN} = \frac{33000 H \,\text{kW}}{\pi (d\,\text{mm})(n\,\text{rpm})}\\
	W_t = \frac{H}{v}\\
\end{gathered} 
$$

**Force Analysis of Bevel**

Bevel, helical and worm gears have a tangential, radial and axial components for their transmitted load. The additional axial load can be offloaded with the use of push bearings. In the case of bevel gears we can use the same formula for the tangential load since there is no torques involved. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{US Units}\\
	W_t \,\text{lbf} = \frac{33000 H \,\text{hp}}{V \,\text{ft/min}}\\
	\text{SI Units}\\
	W_t \,\text{kN} = \frac{33000 H \,\text{kW}}{\pi (d\,\text{mm})(n\,\text{rpm})}\\\\

1. The tangential load happens at the contact point of the driver with an opposite load by the driven.
2. The radial load happens from the contact point to the center of the gear.
3. The axial load is opposite to the radial load but happens on the shaft of the other gear. 

**Force Analysis of Helical**

The main difference with bevel gears is that the radial load needs to be decomposed directly from the transmitted load or indirectly from the tangential load:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	W_r = W\sin(\Phi_n) = W_t \tan(\Phi_t)\\
	W_a = W\cos(\Phi_n)\sin(\Psi) = W_t \tan(\Psi)\\
	W_t = W\cos(\Phi_n)\cos(\Psi)
\end{gathered} 
$$

**Force Analysis of Worm**

For the worm gear the force analysis is more complex since we need to take into account the friction coefficient ($f$):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	W^x = W\cos(\Phi_n)\sin(\lambda) = W_{Wt} = -W_{Ga}\\
	W^y = W\sin(\Phi_n) = W_{Wr} = -W_{Gr}\\
	W^z = W\cos(\Phi_n)\cos(\lambda) = W_{Wa} = -W_{Gt}\\
	W^x = W(\cos(\Phi_n)\sin(\lambda)+f(\cos(\lambda)))
	W^y = W\sin(\Phi_n)\\
	W^z = W(\cos(\Phi_n)\cos(\lambda)+f(\cos(\lambda)))\\
	W_f = (f)(W) = \frac{fW_{Gt}}{(f)(\sin(\lambda)) - \cos(\Phi_n)\cos(\lambda)}\\
	W_{Wt} = (W_{Gt})\frac{\cos(\Phi_n)\sin(\lambda) + (f)(\cos(\lambda))}{(f)(\sin(\lambda)) - \cos(\Phi_n)\cos(\lambda)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Bevel and Worm Force](/static/images/notes/MachinesDeWormBevelAnalysisFo.png)

Since there are power losses related to friction we usually need to calculate the efficiency of the gears:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\eta = \frac{W_{Wt} \text{ No Friction}}{W_{Wt} \text{ With Friction}}\\
	\eta = \frac{\cos(\Phi_n)- (f)(\tan(\lambda))}{\cos(\Phi_n) + (f)(\cot(\lambda))}
\end{gathered}
$$

For a typical value of $f=0.05$ and a normal pressure angle of 20 we have efficiency as a function of the lead angle:

| Lead Angle | Efficiency | 
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 25.2 |
| 2.5 | 45.7 |
| 5 | 62.6 |
| 7.5 | 71.3 |
| 10 | 76.6 |
| 15 | 82.7 |
| 20 | 85.6 |
| 30 | 88.7 |

The friction coefficient is dependent on the sliding velocity between the gear and worm teeth $V_W = V_G + V_S$, this implies that $V_S = \frac{V_W}{\cos(\lambda)}$. Once we have the sliding velocity we can obtain the coefficient graphically with (A) for common materials such as cast iron and (B) for high quality gears:

For example, suppose the spur gears have a module of 12mm and a pressure angle of 20°, the pinion rotates at 1800 rpm clockwise transmitting 150kW through the idler shaft and then arriving at gear (5) on the shaft (c). Calculate the forces that gears 3 and 4 have on the idler shaft:

![Gear Example Spur Analysis](/static/images/notes/MachineDesGearAnalisisExampleSpur.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_2 = 18\\
	m = 12 \, \text{mm}\\
	\Phi = 20\\
	n = 1800\\
	H = 150 \, \text{kW}\\
\end{gathered} 
$$

From the gear (2) we have a transmission load with a radial ($W_{r23}$) and a tangential ($W_{t23}$) component. From the gear (5) we have a transmission load with a radial ($W_{54}$) and a tangential ($W_{t54}$) component. Both loads generate a response ($W_b$) on the idler shaft.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	W_t = \frac{H}{v}\\
	d_2 = N_2(m) = 18(12) = 216 \, \text{mm}\\
	v = \frac{\pi (d) (n)}{60} = \frac{\pi (0.216) (1800)}{60} = 20.35\, \text{m/s}\\
	W_t = \frac{150000}{20.35} = 7370 \, \text{N}\\
	W_r = W_t(\tan(\Phi)) = 7.37 \, \text{kN}(\tan(20)) = 2.68\,\text{kN}\\
	d_3 = N_3(m) = 32(12) = 384 \, \text{mm}\\
	d_4 = N_4(m) = 18(12) = 216 \, \text{mm}\\
	\sum M_b = 0 = ((+W_{t23})(r_3)) + ((-W_{t54})(r_4))\\
	W_{t54} = \frac{r_3}{r_4}W_{t23} = \frac{d_3}{d_4}W_{t23}\\
	W_{t54} = \frac{384}{216}7.37 = 13.10 \, \text{kN}\\
	W_{r54} = W_t(\tan(\Phi)) = 13.1\tan(20) = 4.77 \, \text{kN}\\
	\text{Assuming Shaft W is Possitive}\\
	\sum F_x = 0 = W_{bx} + W_{t23} - W_{r54}\\
	W_{bx} =  W_{r54} - W_{t23} = 4.77 - 7.37 = -2.6\, \text{kN}\\
	\sum F_y = 0 = W_{by} + W_{r23} - W_{t54}\\
	W_{by} =  W_{t54} - W_{r23} = 13.1 - 2.68 = 10.42\, \text{kN}\\
	\therefore W_b = +2.6i - 10.42j\,\, [kN]
\end{gathered} 
$$

For example, suppose the bevel gear has pinion with a 10 diametral pitch of 18 Tooth and a pressure angle of 20. The gear has 30 tooth. The transmitted load is 25 lbf. Calculate the reactions that C and D have on the output shaft, assuming that D has to take the radial and axial loads:

![Gear Example Bevel Analysis](/static/images/notes/MachineDesGearAnalisisExampleBevel.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = 10\,\text{T/in}\\
	N_2 = 18 \, \text{T}\\
	N_3 = 30 \, \text{T}\\
	\Phi = 20\\
	W_t = 25\,\text{lb}
\end{gathered} 
$$

We will ignore the forces on the gear (2) since we are focusing on the bearings on gear (3). We are considering that the bearing (C) supports a radial load given by ($C_x$ and $C_z$). The bearing (D) supports a radial and axial load given by ($D_x$, $D_y$ and $D_z$). The pitch point has the usual transmission load given by its axial, tangential and radial components.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	W_r = W_t \tan(\Phi) \cos(\Gamma)\\
	W_a = W_t \tan(\Phi) \sin(\Gamma)\\
	\tan(\Gamma) = \frac{N_G}{N_P}\\
	\Gamma = \tan^{-1}\frac{30}{18} = 59°\\
	W_r = W_t \tan(20) \cos(59) = 4.68\,\text{lb}\\
	W_a = W_t \tan(20) \sin(59) = 7.80\,\text{lb}\\
	\text{Pitch Point Height}\\
	\cos(\Gamma) = \frac{h}{0.25}\\
	h = 0.25(\cos(59)) = 0.13 \,\text{in}\\
\end{gathered} 
$$

In this model we can see that along the output shaft there is only one unbalanced load, that is the tangential component, to maintain the system in equilibrium we will assume that a torque rotates opposite to the torque that the tangential component will produce.

For example, suppose a high quality R.H. worm gear has a rating of 2000 W at 600 rpm when meshed with a cast iron 48 tooth gear. The axial pitch of the worm is 25mm, its normal pressure angle is 14.5, its pitch diameter is 100mm and its face width is 100mm. The gear has a face width of 50mm. There are bearings (A) and (B) along the worm shaft. Determine which one should be the thrust bearing, so that the axial load is in compression, and find the forces exerted by both bearings.

![Gear Example Worm Analysis](/static/images/notes/MachineDesGearAnalisisExampleWorm.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_W = 1\,\text{T}\\
	N_G = 48\,\text{T}\\
	H = 2000\,\text{W}\\
	n = 600\,\text{rpm}\\
	p_x = 25\,\text{mm}\\
	\Phi_n = 14.5°\\
	d_W = 100\,\text{mm}
\end{gathered} 
$$

Since the worm is right handed we could assume that the bearing (A) is the one that should be the thrust bearing, therefore there will be three components to its load while the bearing (B) will only have two.
