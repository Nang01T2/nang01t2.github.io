# Prologue

** Electronics ** are systems made up of circuits. ** Electronic Engineering ** studies the movement of charge in a vacuum, gas or * semiconductor *. ** Electrical Engineering ** studies the movement of charge in a conductor. In its early days, electronics used vacuum tubes, then transistors and finally circuits, ** Microelectronics ** for its part studied integrated circuits made up of millions of components in a single semiconductor.

![DispositivosElectrónicos](/static/images/electronica/PrologoUno.png)

The first ** Transistor ** was created at Bell Telephone Labs by William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdYHljZi7ys). For decades transistors were discrete with their terminals soldered directly to the circuit until in 1958 Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments created the first ** Integrated Circuit ** with germanium, shortly after Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor would create an integrated circuit with silicon.

![Transistor](/static/images/electronica/PrologoDos.png)

At the beginning the circuits were manufactured with bipolar transistors and later with MOSFETs, these advances in manufacturing allowed to create complex ** Microprocessors ** with logic, arithmetic and memory functions. Microprocessors today are manufactured with variants of the MOSFET including CMOS and recently FinFET [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bor0qLifjz4). ** Passive ** electrical components are those that modify the flow of current by receiving or storing an amount of power. ** Active ** electrical components are those that provide and / or control an amount of power by redistributing or amplifying electrical current.

	\frac{Q}{t} \text{ = Corriente en Amperes} \\
	\text{V = Potencial en Volts} \\

\end{gathered}
$$

The ** Circuits ** have two inputs: a power source and a signal. If the ** Signal ** varies over time it generally must be amplified before it is useful. Note that the output signal of the circuit will depend on both inputs: the signal will determine its shape while the power source will determine its maximum power limit.

![Diagrama](/static/images/electronica/PrologoCuatro.png)

The signal source can be analog or digital, most signals in the real world are primarily analog. ** Analog ** signals are represented by a voltage value that changes over time, an analog circuit preserves the shape of the signal without distorting it, thus an analog amplifier is considered a linear function of the signal. ** Digital ** signals are discrete, they are represented by a voltage that only one and only one of some determined voltages can acquire.

# Semiconductors

Most electronics are made with ** Semiconductors ** made of silicon, other materials like gallium arsenide are used only in specialized applications like optical devices. The reason for the use of these materials lies in their electrochemical properties. We know that atoms have protons, neutrons, and electrons. The ** Electrons ** are distributed in orbits or energy levels that increase in energy the further they are from the nucleus. The highest level electrons are ** Valencia ** electrons and their number will determine the electrochemical properties of any material. Composite semiconductors use Group 4 elemental semiconductors and some other Group 3 or Group 5 doping material.

| Elemental Semiconductors | Composite Semiconductors |
| :---: | :---: |
| Silicon (Si) - 14 | Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) - 33 and 31 |
| Germanium (Ge) - 32 | Gallium phosphide (GaP) - 15 and 31 |
|  | Aluminum Phosphide (AlP) - 15 and 13 |
|  | Aluminum Arsenide (AlAs) - 33 and 13 |
|  | Indium Phosphide (InP) - 15 and 49 |

When the valence electrons of two compatible atoms interact, ** Covalent Bonds ** are created, which in turn create an atomic mesh, if the mesh has a ** Tetrahedral ** configuration, a ** Crystal ** will be formed. A crystal is a solid with defined and symmetrical atomic patterns. Silicon has 4 valence electrons that, when interacting with other silicones, form 4 covalent bonds, a tetrahedral mesh and therefore a crystal. A ** Long Range ** or single crystal is one whose pattern is repeated throughout the entire structure, a ** Short Range ** crystal or polycrystalline crystal is one whose pattern is repeated in fragments or sub-crystals that go changing orientation (natural) and an ** Amorphous ** crystal is one whose pattern changes every few atoms, for example glass.

![Cristal](/static/images/electronica/SemiconductoresUno.png)

If we assume that the absolute ** Temperature ** is $ T = 0 $ all the electrons in the crystal will be in their lowest energy state and the valence electrons will strongly occupy their covalent bonds, even if an electric current is applied (energy ) these will remain in your ** Valencia Band **, in this case the silicon is a perfect insulator. As the temperature increases, some electrons acquire enough additional thermal energy to break their bonds and become free electrons within the ** Conduction Band **. These free electrons in turn leave a positive space or ** Hole ** in the covalent bond in which they were located. The passage of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band is called ** Generation ** of electrons. Between both bands there is a third ** Forbidden Band ** where electrons do not exist since, as they are manifestations of quantum waves, their movement is impossible for said energy interval. Those materials with a band gap greater than 3 eV are considered insulators since at room temperature they need a lot of applied energy to start generating a flow of free electrons. Around 1 eV the materials behave like semiconductors and around 0 eV they are considered conductors. One eV or ** Electron-Volt ** is the energy required to accelerate an electron through a differential potential of 1 V and corresponds to about $ 1.6 \ times 10 ^ 3 \, J $.

![Electrones](/static/images/electronica/SemiconductoresDos.png)

As the temperature increases, the generation of an electron (A) arises where the hole that it leaves behind (A ') is positively charged by the additional proton of the atom, this free electron (A) has too much thermal energy to return to its hole ( A ') however if some valence electron (B) is also released from a nearby atom then this second electron will fill in the hole (A'). The initial free electron has a negative charge movement through the crystal so it generates a ** Current **, however a positive charge movement also occurs through the crystal that also generates a current. Therefore the current in semiconductor depends on both the flow of negative electrons and the flow of positive holes. Likewise, both fluxes depend directly on the ** Concentration ** number per $ cm ^ 3 $ of electrons and holes. An ** Intrinsic Semiconductor ** is one that is composed of a single material and in its case the concentration of electrons $ n_i $ and holes $ p_i $ must be the same since for each electron generated a single hole $ n_i is also generated = p_i $. The following formula allows us to obtain the ** Intrinsic Carrier Concentration ** of an intrinsic semiconductor at a certain temperature. And as we know it will be the same for both electrons and holes.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n\_{i} = BT^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{\frac{-E\_{g}}{2kT}} \\
	\text{B = Coeficiente especifico del material} \\
	\text{T = Temperatura absoluta en Kelvin} \\
	\text{e = Función Exponencial} \\
	\text{Eg = Energía de Banda Prohibida} \\
	\text{k = Constante de Boltzmann = } 86 \times 10^{-6} \frac{eV}{K}
\end{gathered}
$$

| Material           | Eg ($eV$) |   B ($\frac{1}{cm^3 K^\frac{3}{2}}$) |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Silicon           | 1.1       |   $5.23 \times 10^{15}$ |              
| Gallium arsenide | 1.4       |   $2.10 \times 10^{14}$ |
| Germanium           | 0.66      |   $1.66 \times 10^{15}$ |

For example, for a silicon crystal at room temperature with a $ B = 5.23 \ times 10 ^ {15} $, $ T = 300K $ and $ Eg = 1.1 $ we have:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n\_i = BT^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{\frac{-E\_g}{2kT}} \\
	n\_i = (5.23 \times 10^{15})(300)^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{\frac{-1.1}{2(86 \times 10^{-6})(300)}} = 1.5 \times 10^{10} \frac{\text{electrones}}{cm^3} \\
	\text{Minusculo comparado con la concentración de atomos de } 
\end{gathered}
$$

We observe with the previous result that intrinsic semiconductors at room temperature generate an insignificant concentration of carriers compared to the concentration of atoms $ 5 \ times 10 ^ {22} \ frac {\ text {atoms}} {cm ^ 3} $ in it volume. In order to drastically increase the concentration of electrons or holes, it is necessary to add impurities (** Doping **) or atoms of another element that has a different configuration of valence electrons, turning the intrinsic semiconductor into one ** Extrinsic **. In the case of silicon, phosphorus with 5 valence electrons can be added creating 4 covalent bonds as if it were a silicon but also automatically donating its fifth electron to the conduction band. It is very ** Important ** to note that the phosphor atom that donated its electron remains positive but unlike a hole it cannot move and therefore its positive charge will not generate a current. This impurity is considered ** Donor ** since it increases the concentration of free electrons without increasing holes. The semiconductor with excess electrons is called ** Type-N ** (negative N) where its majority carrier are electrons and the minority are holes. On the other hand, if Boron were added, which has 3 valence electrons, the 3 would be used to create covalent bonds but it could not create a fourth. Like a hole in silicon, the boron hole can move when an attached valence electron accepts it and fills the hole. This impurity is considered ** Acceptor ** since it increases the concentration of holes without increasing the free electrons. The semiconductor with excess holes is called ** Type-P ** (P for positive) where the majority carrier are the holes and the minority are the electrons.

![Electrones](/static/images/electronica/SemiconductoresCuatro.png)

The following formula is a fundamental relationship between the concentration of carriers of an intrinsic semiconductor and its concentration of electrons or holes when it has been doped if it is in thermal equilibrium:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n\_i^2 = (n\_o)(p\_o)\\
	n\_o \text{ = Concentracion de electrones del material} \\
	\text{dopado en equilibrio termico} \\
	p\_o \text{ = Concentracion de agujeros del material} \\
	\text{dopado en equilibrio termico}
\end{gathered}
$$

If a semiconductor is doped to be Type-N then at room temperature we can assume that the vast majority of donor impurities have already released their electrons, so $ n_o $ will not come from the intrinsic concentration but from the concentration of donor impurities $ N_d $, similarly if the semiconductor is doped to be of Type-P then at room temperature we can assume that the vast majority of acceptor impurities have already generated holes, so $ p_o $ will not come from the intrinsic concentration but of the concentration of acceptor impurities $ N_a $. This is reflected in the previous formula as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n\_i^2 = (n\_o)(p\_o)\\
	\text{Dopaje Tipo-N} \\
	n\_o \cong N\_d \implies n\_i^2 = (N\_d)(p\_o)\\
	p\_o = \frac{n\_i^2}{N\_d} \\
	\text{Dopaje Tipo-P} \\
	p\_o \cong N\_a \implies n\_i^2 = (n\_o)(N\_a)\\
	n\_o = \frac{n\_i^2}{N\_a}
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, for a silicon crystal ($ n_i = 1.5 \ times 10 <10 $) doped with phosphorus at T = 300K at a concentration of $ N_d = 1 \ times 10 <16 \ frac {phosphorus} { cm ^ 3} $ we have to:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n\_o \cong 1 \times 10^{16} \implies (1.5 \times 10^{10})^2 = (1 \times 10^{16})(p\_o)\\
	p\_o = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}{1 \times 10^{16}} = 2.25 \times 10^4
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, for a silicon crystal ($ n_i = 1.5 \ times 10 ^ {10} $) doped with boron at T = 300K at a concentration of $ N_a = 5 \ times 10 ^ {16} \ frac {boron} { cm ^ 3} $ we have to:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	p\_o \cong 5 \times 10^{16} \implies (1.5 \times 10^{10})^2 = (n\_o)(5 \times 10^{16})\\
	n\_o = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}{5 \times 10^{16}} = 4.5 \times 10^3
\end{gathered}
$$

# Current Density 

The orderly movement of carriers, be it electrons or holes, generates a current, there are two ways to generate this movement: By ** Diffusion ** or by ** Drag **. When we apply an electric field $ E $ to the semiconductor, this field applies a force to any charged particle, in this case the carriers. This force translates into movement at a given speed, for electrons their movement is in the opposite direction to the direction of the electric field while for holes their movement is in the same direction. We call the current generated by an electric field ** Drag Current Density **. In an N-Type semiconductor the ** Velocity ** in $ \ frac {cm} {s} $ that the electrons acquire is given by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_{dn} = -\mu\_n E
\end{gathered}
$$

The ** Mobility Constant ** $ \ mu $ given in $ \ frac {cm ^ 2} {(V) (s)} $ represents the ease of an electron or a hole in said material to move and acquire a velocity , in this case the negative sign represents the opposite direction of the electron to the electric field. The electron mobility constant of a lightly doped N-Type silicon crystal is approximately $ 1350 \, \ frac {cm ^ 2} {(V) (s)} $ The velocity of electrons $ V_ {dn } $ in turn determines the electron drag current density $ J_n $:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J\_n = -e n\_o V\_{dn} = -e n\_o (-\mu\_n E) = e n\_o \mu\_n E \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	\text{e = Carga del electrón} \\
	n\_o \text{ = Concentración de electrones} 
\end{gathered}
$$

In a Type-P semiconductor, the speed in $ \ frac {cm} {s} $ that the holes acquire is given by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_{dp} = \mu\_p E
\end{gathered}
$$

The hole mobility constant of a lightly doped P-Type silicon crystal is approximately $ 480 \, \ frac {cm ^ 2} {(V) (s)} $. The dragging velocity of the electrons $ V_ {dn} $ determines the current density of the hole dragging $ J_p $:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J\_p = e p\_o V\_{dp} = e p\_o (\mu\_p E) = e p\_o \mu\_n E \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	\text{e = Carga del electrón} \\
	p\_o \text{ = Concentración de agujeros} 
\end{gathered}
$$

The density of ** Total Drag Current ** in a semiconductor is the sum of both current densities, although one will dominate over the other depending on whether it is N-Type or P-Type:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J = J\_n + J\_p = e n\_o \mu\_n E + e p\_o \mu\_p E \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	\sigma = e n\_o \mu\_n + e p\_o \mu\_p \implies J = \sigma E \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	\sigma \text{ = Conductividad eléctrica en } \quad \frac{1}{\Omega cm} \\
	\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} \implies J = \frac{E}{\rho} \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	\rho \text{ = Resistividad eléctrica en } \quad \Omega cm \\
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that if $ E $ is an electric field produced by the application of a voltage then the above formula is the origin of ** Ohm's Law ** only multiplying by $ cm ^ 2 $:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J = \frac{E}{\rho} \implies I = (J)(A) \implies I = \frac{V}{R} \\
	\text{A = Área transversal del semiconductor}
\end{gathered}
$$

When using these drag equations of velocity $ V_ {dn} \, and \, V_ {dp} $, it must be considered that they are linear relations as long as the field is small, when increasing the electric field $ E $ we arrive at a maximum speed (** Saturated Drag Speed **) which is equivalent to approximately $ 10 7 \, \ frac {cm} {s} $. It must also be considered that the mobility constants actually depend slightly on the concentration of each impurity (increasing the concentration decreases the mobility), so they are not really constant, this is taken into account so as not to assume that there is a direct relationship between conductivity and concentration of impurities.

For example, for a silicon crystal at $ T = 300K $ doped with arsenic at a concentration of $ N_d = 8 \times 10 ^ {15} \frac{arsenic}{cm ^ 3} $ and with mobility constants of $ \ mu_n = 1350 \, \ frac {cm ^ 2} {(V) (s)} $ and $ \ mu_p = 480 \, \ frac {cm ^ 2} {(V) (s)} $ within a field $ 100 electric \ frac {V} {cm} $ we have:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n \cong N\_d \implies p = \frac{n\_i^2}{N\_d} = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}{8\times 10^{15}} = 2.81 \times 10^4 \\
	(n>>p) \implies ep\mu\_p E \approx 0 \implies \sigma = em\mu\_m E \\
	\sigma = (1.6\times 10^{-19})(1350)(8\times 10^{15})= 1.73 \frac{1}{\Omega cm}\\
	J = \sigma E \implies J = (1.73)(100) = 173 \frac{A}{cm^2}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

In the case of ** Diffusion Current Density ** it is not an electric field but a concentration difference between a ** Region ** of high concentration and a region of low concentration that produces the movement of carriers. This movement has its origin in the simple application of the ** Kinetic Theory ** to the concept of diffusion: both electrons and holes by definition are in constant movement due to their additional thermal energy, in this case their direction is practically random, by probability we can assume that for any instant of time about half of the particles will move from the high concentration region to the low one, likewise about half the particles from the low concentration region will move to the high one, without However note that by definition the low concentration region will send a smaller amount of particles creating a net movement or flow of particles from the high concentration region to the low concentration region.

![Electrones](/static/images/electronica/DensidadCorrienteDos.png)

Unlike the current density by drag, in the diffusion the speed of the particles is implicit in the ** Diffusion Coefficient ** of said carrier. In this way, the diffusion current densities are given by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J\_n = e D\_n \frac{dn}{dx} \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	D\_n\text{ = Coeficiente de difusión de electrones en el material} \\
	\frac{dn}{dx} \text{ = Gradiente unidimensional de concentración de electrones} \\
	J\_p = -e D\_p \frac{dp}{dx} \quad \frac{A}{cm^2} \\
	D\_p\text{ = Coeficiente de difusión de agujeros en el material} \\
	\frac{dp}{dx}\text{ = Gradiente unidimensional de concentración de agujeros} \\
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, for a silicon crystal at $T = 300K$ doped with arsenic with a concentration that varies linearly from n = 10 12 $\frac{arsenic}{cm ^ 3}$ to $n = 10^{16} \frac {arsenic}{cm ^ 3}$ at a distance of $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 3 \mu m $ and with an electron diffusion coefficient of $ D_n = 35 \frac{cm^2}{s} $ we have to:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	J\_n = e D\_n \frac{dn}{dx} \implies  (1.6\times 10^{-19})(35)(\frac{10^{12}-10^{16}}{0-(3\times 10^{-9})}) = 187 \quad \frac{A}{cm^2}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the constants $ D_n \ quad D_p \ quad \ mu n \ quad \ mu p $ are related by the ** Einstein relation ** which says that any carry-over and diffusion in the same medium at room temperature are equivalent to:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{D\_n}{\mu n} = \frac{D\_p}{\mu p} = \frac{kT}{e} \approx 0.026 V
\end{gathered}
$$

The semiconductor has a ** Total Current Density ** equal to the sum of the entrainment current density and the diffusion current density. Note that the above example calculations gave approximate results of $ 200 \ frac {A} {cm ^ 2} $, since $ I = (J) (A) $ then silicon with this current density only needs an area of $ 5 \ times 10 ^ {- 6} \, cm ^ 2 $ in order to provide a * large * $ 1 \, mA $ current, this is why transistors can be so small.

***

# Carrier Excess

Until now, it has been assumed that the semiconductor is in thermal equilibrium at an ambient temperature of $ T = 300K $, however it is almost inevitable that at this temperature, where the material is no longer insulating, it will not interact with high-voltage photons. energy from the environment. These photons normally pass through the empty spaces between atoms, however they sometimes collide with the electrons in the crystal, increasing their energy, creating a thermal imbalance and forcing the breakdown of covalent bonds. These extra electron pairs and holes are called ** Excess Carriers ** and increase the total carrier concentration regardless of whether the semiconductor is intrinsic or extrinsic. In real life, no semiconductor is really in thermal equilibrium, so its real concentration of carriers will always be given by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	n = n\_o + \delta n\\
	p = p\_o + \delta p
\end{gathered}
$$

It should be noted that although the semiconductor is constantly exposed to these photons, the amount of excess carriers does not increase indefinitely, at a point a saturation of excess carriers is reached where free electrons fill holes naturally (** Recombination Electron-Hole **) at the same speed as photons generate new pairs of excess carriers. The average time it takes a free electron to fill a hole naturally is called the ** Life Time ** of the excess carrier. Reaching this equilibrium point, the semiconductor will maintain a quantity of carriers in constant excess. Excess carriers are the basis that solar panels use to generate electrical energy.
