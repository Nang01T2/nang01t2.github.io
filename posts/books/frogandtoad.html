<p><strong>Story 1: Spring</strong></p>
<p>Frog came running to warn Toad of the arrival of spring but apparently Toad was still sleeping so Frog decided to enter his house and forcibly wake him up while Toad protested. Frog told him about all the wonderful things that one can lose when they remain sleeping, but Toad was convinced that there was nothing more wonderful than sleep so planning to sleep a whole year he told Frog to wake him up until the following sprint and Toad went back to sleep. Frog didn&#x27;t want to give up so easily so he removed 12 months from Toad&#x27;s calendar, and after a few hours went back and wake up Toad again. Frog told Toad that a whole year had passed, Toad didn&#x27;t believed him it at first but when he saw his calendar he finally decided that he had slept enough and it was time to get out and spend some time with his friend.</p>
<p><strong>Story 2: The Story</strong></p>
<p>One day Frog felt terribly ill and looked greener than usual, Toad treat it as any good friend would and brought him a cup of tea, then Frog asked him to tell him a story so that he could rest and recover but Toad did not remember any. Toad tried everything for hours trying to remember a story, he stood on his head, splashed cold water on himself even starting hitting his head but all without success. Frog even told Toad that he didn&#x27;t needed the story anymore since he was feeling better. But now Toad was the one in bed and feeling terrible after everything he had done and asked Frog to tell him a story. Frog told Toad the story of a good hearted Toad that tried to tell a story to his frog friend but failed. When Frog finished his story Toad fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Story 3: The Lost Button</strong></p>
<p>One day the couple of friends went for a walk but when they returned home, Toad had dropped a button from his jacket, Frog tried to comfort him by telling him that they would retrace their steps and return to where he lost his button. So they began the arduous search for the missing button but despite the fact that they found many buttons of different sizes with the help of their forest friends Toad did not find his original button and angrily left Frog, ungratefully telling him that his help was useless. When Toad entered the house he found the lost button and felt a deep remorse for his attitude with Frog. He sew all the buttons they had found in the forest to his jacked and the next day gave it to Frog as a way of thanking him for his efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Story 4: A Bath</strong></p>
<p>One day they went down to the river to take a bath, when they arrived Frog undressed quickly and entered into the river, Toad slowly put on his bathing suit, but even then he felt so ashamed of how he looked that he asked Frog to not see him while on the river, because Frog was a good friend he agreed. They swam all afternoon but when they where ready to leave a turtle appeared, Toad told Frog to tell the turtle to leave because he didn&#x27;t wanted to be seen. Frog told the turtle but instead of leaving the turtle become curious about why Toad didn&#x27;t wanted to be seen and told everybody in the forest that Toad had a secret underwater. Soon after a crowd gathered waiting for Toad to get out of the water so they could know his secret. Frog got out of the water but Toad stayed inside since he figured that they would get bored waiting for him however that didn&#x27;t happen and as the night fell the water started to get very cold. Toad couldn&#x27;t take it any longer and his greatest fear became true as everybody in the forest saw him getting out of the water using his bathing suit.</p>
<p><strong>Story 5: The Letter</strong></p>
<p>One day Frog came to see how Toad was doing, Toad was waiting for the mail but had a sad face, Frog asked Toad what was wrong and Toad replied that he had never received a mail in his whole life and was waiting if maybe today was the day that someone would send him a letter. So Frog and Toad stood there waiting with sad faces for a letter that would never arrive. Then Frog had an idea and ran to his house and wrote a letter to Toad, then he gave it to the first animal he saw and told him to leave it in Toad&#x27;s mailbox. The first animal he saw was a friendly snail that gladly agreed. Frog ran back to Toad&#x27;s house and told him that he still wanted to wait for the mail with him, Toad told him that he had given up all hope but Frog told him what he had done and that soon he would receive his first letter. So they both waited for Toad&#x27;s mail again but this time they where both happy and telling each other jokes and laughing, the only problem was that the letter never arrived. After four days the snail finally arrived to Toad&#x27;s house, Toad had totally forgotten about it but felt completely happy for the surprise letter that his friend had written to him a few days back.</p></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"postMetadata":{"title":"Frog and Toad","date":"2016-01-04","tags":["books","kids"]},"postContent":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    em: \"em\",\n    hr: \"hr\",\n    strong: \"strong\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"With the series \", _jsx(_components.em, {\n        children: \"Mouse Tales\"\n      }), \" and \", _jsx(_components.em, {\n        children: \"Frog and Toad\"\n      }), \" the author Arnold Lobel became a classic of American children's literature, this was the first book of the second series and it received the Caldecott Award.\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.hr, {}), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.strong, {\n        children: \"Story 1: Spring\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Frog came running to warn Toad of the arrival of spring but apparently Toad was still sleeping so Frog decided to enter his house and forcibly wake him up while Toad protested.
