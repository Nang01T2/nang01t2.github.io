Historical artifact from september 1994. 

Hymn of the internet created by the first human beings who met somewhere in the cyberspace.

<div className="italic">

The people's web is deepest red,<br/>
And oft it's killed our routers dead.<br/>
But ere the bugs grew ten days old,<br/>
The patches fixed the broken code.<br/>

So raise the open standard high<br/>
Within its codes we'll live or die<br/>
Though cowards flinch and Bill Gates sneers<br/>
We'll keep the net flag flying here.<br/>
