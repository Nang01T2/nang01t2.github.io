Hello, my name is Nguyen Nang and I am a senior software engineer from Evizi. I work as a full-stack engineer, which means I develop both the front-end and the back-end of web applications. In my free time, I enjoy blogging about various topics related to technology, programming, and personal development. I hope to share my knowledge and experience with others through my blog posts.
