Planet B is the personal blog of [Jamie](https://twitter.com/jamiebeach) where since 2002 he showcases his programming proyects. I found his blog because of his Syntax Highlighter For Word tool based on [Google's Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/). Other interesting projects are a [Solitaire Game](http://www.planetb.ca/projects/sosolitaire/) based on JS (CocoonJS and PixiDev), a [Snakes Game](http://www.planetb.ca/projects/svgsnake/snake.svg) based on JS and SVG and a [Kids Memory Game](http://www.planetb.ca/kids-make-a-match) based on JS.
