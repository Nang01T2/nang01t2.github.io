# Introduction

Thermodynamics is the science of energy, its transformations and relation with matter. 

**Energy**

Universal quantity that allows a body or system to perform a job or increase their heat compared to another system. Thermodynamics comes from the Greek word *therme* meaning heat and *dynamis* meaning force, it originated from the first attempts at transforming heat into work using the first atmospheric steam machines made by Thomas Savery in 1697 and Thomas Newcomen in 1712.

**Work**

Capacity of a body with energy of transferring that energy to another body via macroscopic movements in a particular direction, represented by forces and displacements. For example, work can be positive when a gas is compressed (absorbing energy), negative when a gas expands (releasing energy) or neutral when there is no net force or torque.

**Heat**

Capacity of a body with energy of transferring that energy via microscopic thermal collisions in random directions, represented by temperature differentials. Heat is positive when ambient temperature is higher (absorbing energy), negative when ambient temperature is lower (releasing energy) or neutral when there is no temperature differential.

**Internal Energy**

Represents the total total kinetic and potential energy from every particle in a system. It is quantified as the total change in energy, where a change in energy is a differential of the input energy with respect to the output energy. $\Delta E = E_{in} - E_{out}$. 

**Law of conservation of energy**

This law states that energy can change form but its total quantity inside a system will remain constant, meaning that you can't create nor destroy it. Energy forms can be classified into kinetic (movement), subdivided into thermal, mechanical, electrical, radiant, sound or mechanical wave; or into potential (position inside a field), subdivided into magnetic, gravitational, chemical, ionizing, nuclear or elastic.

**First law**

This law states that energy is a thermodynamic property that follows the law of conservation of energy, this means that the internal energy of a system can change only after a transfer of energy with another system via heat or work. $IE = \Delta Q - \Delta W$. Note that the first law is valid up to a chemical level but isn't reliable when describing quantum systems. 

**Second law**

This law states that the total quantity of energy in a system and its environment will remain constant, however the energy quality may change, usually decreasing in quality or dispersing and therefore increasing the system entropy. 

**Entropy**

Measure of energy dispersal in a system, dispersed energy needs an external source of energy to be transformed back into localized energy, that external source of energy will overall disperse more energy, this necessarily means that the total universal entropy is always increasing.

Entropy is an emergent statistical property that arises from the spontaneous change in energy configurations or microstates and the higher quantity of dispersed microstates, meaning that the next spontaneous energy change will more likely be disperse (asymmetric and unordered) instead of localized (symmetrical and ordered).

**Heat Flow** 

Transfer of energy through heat, represented by a temperature differential. Notice that heat flow originates in entropy, having a higher temperature just means that the region has localized energy and as time goes on its next spontaneous microstate will likely be dispersed instead of retaining that order by itself.

**Third law**

This law states that entropy becomes constant when a system approaches a temperature of 0 K, it was proposed by Walther Nernst in 1906. 

At higher temperatures the atomic vibrations allow for multiple dispersal energy microstates, however as you lower the temperature this number decreases until you are left with the *ground state* as the only possible energy configuration.

The first and second laws where created simultaneously in 1850 by Macquorn Rankine, Rudolph Clausius and Lord Kelvin. Kelvin was the first one to use the term *thermodynamics* in 1849 while Rankine wrote the first treaty about it in 1859 and Clausius introduced the concept of entropy in 1865.

**Classic thermodynamics**

Studies the average behavior of a group of molecules neglecting their individual behavior. It uses the laws of thermodynamics to predict changes in the internal energy of a system.

**Statistical thermodynamics**

Also called mechanical statistics, it studies the behavior of groups of particles taking into account their individual behavior and energy states.

**Units System**

Composed of primary or fundamental units and secondary or derived units. Today most countries use the International System of Units (SI), the United States Customary System (USCS) or the Imperial System of Units.

**Homogeneity**

Physics equations need to have dimensional homogeneity, they must maintain the same unit on both sides. If the equation is heterogeneous it *must* be a false physical equivalence, however this doesn't mean every homogeneous equation is true.

# System

A system is a certain amount of matter, a certain region in space or both. All systems have a surrounding mass or region. A border is what separates the system from its surrounding, a border can be fixed or change with time.

**Open System**

Also called control volumes, they are systems where energy and mass can cross their border. For example compressors, turbine or nozzles where mass and energy can pass through them. The boundaries of a control volume are known as control surfaces and generally coincide with the internal walls of the device.

**Closed System**

Also called control masses, they are systems with a fixed quantity of mass, meaning that energy its the only thing that can cross their border. An isolated system is an special case of a closed system where not even energy can cross their border.

**System Property**

Characteristic of a system. It can be intensive (independent of mass) like pressure, temperature, density or it can be extensive (dependent on mass) like mass, volume, enthalpy, entropy, or heat capacity.

[All System Properties](/blog/school/units#system-properties)

In classical thermodynamics we ignore intermolecular spaces considering matter as an idealized continuous or homogeneous mass. This is valid only when the length of the system is much greater than the average *free path* of the molecules, where the free path is the average distance that the particles need to travel in a vacuum before colliding with each other else *rare gas flow theory* should be used.

**Density**

This property represents the mass present in each unit of volume $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$, similarly the specific weight represents the weight of each unit of volume $\gamma_s = \rho g$. The reciprocal of density is the specific volume representing the volume occupied by each unit of mass $v = \frac{V}{m}$.

Density generally depends on the temperature and pressure of the system. In gases exists a lineal relation where the density is proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature. Liquids and solids are essentially incompressible meaning that their density variation due to changes in pressure is negligible. 

Density can be expressed as unit relative to another standard substance density (at a specific temperature), we call this relative density or specific gravity $RD = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{std}}$. Relative density is dimensionless, however it is usually represented with $\frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}$ or $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}$. If the relative density of a substance A is *less* than the relative density of a substance B then A will float in B.

**System State**

A system point in time where it does not undergo changes and in which all its properties are known. 

**Equilibrium State**

State where the system does not experience internal forces. If every point in system has the same temperature we say it is in *thermal equilibrium*, if every point has the same pressure we say it is in *mechanical equilibrium* (ignoring the pressure gradient caused by gravity), if the chemical composition remains constant we say it is in *chemical equilibrium* etc.

There are states where more than one matter phase can coexists inside the system, additionally this state can be an *equilibrium phase* when each of the matter phases mass remains constant.

**State Postulate**

Depending on the complexity of the system we can completely define or only approximate its current status. This postulate states that a *simple compressible* system state can be determined just by knowing two independent intensive properties, for example temperature and specific volume (as long as the substance does not change phase).

**Process**

Change from one state of equilibrium to another. The process path is the continuous series of non equilibrium states between them. A process is therefore described by an initial state a process path and an end state. A cycle is a type of process where the initial and final states are the same.

**Quasistatic Process**

Also called quasi-equilibrium, is a process where path is composed of states infinitesimally close to equilibrium, generally this happens when the path from one state to another is slow allowing the system to adjust continuously never allowing one of its internal regions to change faster than the rest. 

For every other process where the path is composed of sudden changes and the intermediate states can't adjust quickly enough we say that the trajectory is made up of unbalanced states (Non-Quasistatic Process).

The compression of a gas in a cylinder is quasistatic if it is slow enough to allow the molecules pushed by the plunger to redistribute evenly throughout the volume so that the pressure remains constant, however if the compression is sudden the intermediate states will be mechanically unbalanced since there will be a high pressure region near the plunger.

**Process Diagram**

Used to represent a system process, they use solid lines for quasistatic processes and dashed lines for non-quasistatic processes. We classify processes based on which property remains constant:

* Isothermal: Constant temperature.
* Isobaric: Constant pressure.
* Isometric or Isochoric: Constant specific volume.

A *stable* or *stationary process* is one where all system properties remain the same, notice this does not necessarily mean that the process is in equilibrium. A *steady flow process* is a process where there is mass flow but the process remains stable. 

An *unsteady flow process* is a process where there is mass flow but the process is unstable since some property will change throughout the process. A *uniform process* is a special case of an unsteady flow process where the property that changes does so in a quasistatic manner.

**Equilibrium Process**

When a fluid system can be described by volume, pressure, temperature and heat and one of the properties is fixed then a change in any of the other three must change the rest of the properties. For example, in an isovolumetric process where volume is constant, an increase in heat also means a temperature and pressure increase. 

In an isobaric process pressure is constant, so an increase in heat means that temperature and volume must also increase. Pistons generally use isobaric processes where this change in volume can be transformed to mechanical work defined as the pressure in the container times the area of the piston times the distance it moved $w = (P)(A)(x)$.

In an isothermal process a large container or heat sink is connected to a system that keeps the heat inside so temperature is constant, work in this case since pressure is not a constant anymore equals the integral of pressure times the change in volume, which will be equal to the amount of heat the sink absorbs.

In an adiabatic process no heat is added to the system but the other properties are free to change as the gas expands or compresses, by the first law the internal change in energy will be negative.

# Zeroth Law

It states that if body A and body B are in thermal equilibrium with body C we can conclude that A and B are themselves in thermal equilibrium. It was formulated by Ralph Fowler in 1931, it can't be derived solely from the other thermodynamic laws and it's the basis for temperature measurements.

When we feel something hot or cold what we actually perceive is not temperature but heat flow. To measure temperature we use a repeatable and predictable change of a body temperature and then infer another body temperature based on the zeroth law.

**Temperature Scale**

There have been many temperature scales, all based around standard properties of an arbitrary substance as their reference points. 

The *Celsius scale* or centigrade scale was invented by Anders Celsius in 1742, it uses water ice and vapor points as 0 and 100 respectively. The *Fahrenheit scale* was invented by Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724, it uses water ice and vapor points as 32 and 212 respectively.

The *Rankine scale*  is an absolute scale invented by Macquorn Rankine in 1859, it is used along with the *Ideal Gas scale* in the English system. The latter is measured with a constant volume gas thermometer since at low pressures the temperature of a gas is proportional to that pressure $T = a + bP$. 

The *Kelvin scale* is an absolute scale invented by Lord Kelvin in 1848 when describing how the lowest possible point in the *Ideal Gas scale* converged using different gases. This absolute scale does not depend on a substance such as water, its starting point is the absolute zero and then it uses the Boltzmann constant to define its magnitude which is equivalent to Celsius magnitude.

**Pressure**

In thermodynamics pressure it is the normal force exerted by a fluid per unit area, its solid equivalent is normal stress. 

An absolute pressure is the pressure relative to the absolute zero of vacuum. Most pressure gauges measure positive pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, we call this gauge pressure $P_{gauge} = P_{abs} - P_{atm}$. When we measure negative pressure relative to atmospheric pressure we call it vacuum pressure $P_{vacuum} = P_{atm} - P_{abs}$. 

Positive pressure is a compression force however it is considered a scalar value since at any point in the system pressure is exerted in every direction. When a system is inside a gravitational field horizontal pressure is balanced but vertical pressure forms a gradient where it increases linearly with depth, this is because of the additional weight is countered by additional pressure.

The pressure differential between two points in a fluid of the same density is proportional to their vertical distance, in liquids and gases the pressure differential can be neglected at small distances, low densities or weak gravitational fields. 

**Pascal's Machines**

We can calculate the pressure differential by integrating the constant density by the gravitational acceleration of the field. The Dutch mathematician Simón Stevin published this relation in 1586 now called *Pascal's Law* in honor of Blaise Pascal.

Pascal's Law is the principle behind Pascal's Machines, hydraulic lifters and automobile brakes. Since pressure is the force applied to an area and the pressure must be the same at an horizontal level we can effectively multiply any force just by decreasing the size of the input opening (increasing the individual output pressures) or by increasing the size of the output opening (increasing the number of output pressures).
