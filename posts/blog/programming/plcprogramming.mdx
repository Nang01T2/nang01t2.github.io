# Zelio Logic Safety #

* Use by trained professionals
* Use only if there is a safety point for the operator.
* Automation equipment to control industrial processes.
* Select model of automation equipment based on application, control function required, degree of protection, production methods, government regulations etc.
* Refer to the national or local standards and regulations such as the NSCAP Manual. In many cases point of operation guarding or safety must be provided.
* Before using the automation equipment a startup test is always required.
* Verify that there are no short circuits or temporary ground according to standards such as National Electrical Code in the USA.
* Before energizing the equipment: Remove tools, meters and debris, close the equipment enclosure door, remove all temporary grounds, perform all start up tests.
* Verify all installation and set up have been completed, remove all blocks or temporary holdings, remove tools meters and debris. 
* Operator restrictions and unauthorized changes prevents accidental miss adjustment of the equipment resulting in unsafe operation.

* We recommend you download the product datasheet for specific information.

* Designers of control schemes must consider potential failure modes, paths and functions.
* Achieving a safe statue during and after a failure path has been followed. For example emergency stops and overtravel stops, power outage and restarts.
* Consider redundancy for failure control paths and also failure in the communication links themselves such as unanticipated transmission delays or failures.
* Refer to safety NEMA ICS 1.1 and NEMA ICS 7.1

* Special Care must be taken when using modern remote control devices such as smart relays:

# Zelio Soft 2 #

Zelio Soft 2 Programming Software is designed to program the Zelio Logic Smart Relay family of
controllers. Zelio Soft 2 allows you to choose between programming languages, display program
and parameter data, upload and download applications, and print application documentation.

* In LD mode we can program smart relays with screens.
* To program smart relays without screens we use LD mode (Ladder) or FBD mode (Function Block Diagram).
* This implement timers, counters, time management, character strings and communications.

**Ladder Language**

* Graphic language used to transcribe relay diagrams composed of contacts that let current power coils, it is ideal for combinational processing.
* Maximum number of lines in LD is 120 for SR2COM01 communications or 240 without SR2COM01 
* FBD mode uses predefined function blocks for timing, counters and logic.

* You start by constructing the programs in ENTRY mode and then testing the program in DEBUG MODE, debug mode can be in simulation (program executed offline and simulated in the PC), or in monitoring (program executed on smart relay).
* You can dynamically display output states with EDIT - SUPERVISION - FRONT PANEL.
* Another common activity is to FORCE inputs and outputs to test specific conditions.
