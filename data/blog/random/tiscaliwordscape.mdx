**Polysemy**

Word or phrase that has multiple meanings, where the meanings have a historical or etymological connection. In dictionaries polysemes are included in the same entry. For example course, table or paper.

> To a mechanic, a 'shot' fan belt was a worn one. To a bartender, a 'shot' was a one-ounce glass of whiskey. To a decathlon champion, a 'shot' was an iron ball to be thrown as far as he could throw it. To a tennis player, a 'shot' was what he stroked over the net. To a junkie or a physician, a 'shot' was an injection by hypodermic syringe. To a motion-picture director, a 'shot' was any given camera setup. And to Morris Bloom, a 'shot' was something fired from a gun you could buy off a shelf like a ripe banana. I was very happy I wasn't learning English as a foreign language; I was far too old to be taking a shot at such a formidable task.

**Homonym**

Words or phrases that are homographs, homophones or both. We say it is a *true homonym* when it is both. In dictionaries homonyms are in separate entries. For examle the words bear, just or left.

**Homograph**

Words or phrases with different pronunciations and meanings but coincidentally the same spelling. In dictionaries homographs are in separate entries. For example the word wound meaning an injury and the word wound past tense of the verb to wind. [^1]

**Homophone**

Words or phrases with different spellings and different meanings but coincidentally the same pronunciation. In dictionaries homophones are in separate entries. For example the words fair and fare. [^2]

**Minimal Pairs**

Words whose pronunciation differs by a minimal segment, usually the pronunciation of a single letter. Every combination of Minimum Pairs produces every pronunciation variation in a language. [^3]

**Phonetic Alphabets**

At the time of radio broadcasting, in order to spell the letters clearly, several phonetic alphabets were created, today the NATO phonetic alphabet is the one used in most of the world. [^4]

**Silent Alphabet**

> In 1968 an American linguist, answering the question "How do you pronounce TESOL?" (the acronym of the Association of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages) answered: "T as in castle, E as in give, S as in island, O as in people, and L as in calm." 

Depending on the order of the characters you can create a complete phonetic alphabet made up of the silent letters in every word. [^5]
