# Introduction

Atoms constitute matter, they are made up of Protons, Neutrons and Electrons. Subatomic particles are made up of Quarks: Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Bottom, Top. So a proton is Up, Up Down or a neutron is Down, Down, Up.

The mathematical laws of physics must always explain the observations of nature and their experimentation. However, it is necessary to measure the reality of these experiments until they are reduced to numerical quantities, since every measuring instrument will always have limited precision and accuracy, so there will always be a margin of error.

Statistical significant figures are used in experimental work.

1. The number of significant figures after performing a multiplication or division is the number of figures of the least precise factor, that is, the one with the fewest figures.
2. The number of significant figures after addition or subtraction is the number of decimal digits of the term with the fewest decimal places.

A coordinate system is the representation of space where the axes represent the length. Every system needs a point of reference or origin. Any point in posterior space can be located with respect to the origin.

1. Rectangular coordinate system (x, y).
2. Polar plane coordinate system (r, theta).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{For a triangle rectangle in space}\\
	\sin(\theta) = \frac{y}{r} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \quad \tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}\\
	r^2 = x^2+y^2 \quad y = \sin(\theta r) \quad x = \cos(\theta r)
\end{gathered}
