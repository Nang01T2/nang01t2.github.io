<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>A 99-year-old woman lived alone with her hen, a goat, and a cow. Her husband had died a long time ago and she felt very lonely. One cold and stormy night death arrives at her door, the old woman opens it and death shouts <em>I&#x27;m going to take you</em> (Me la voy a llevar) to which the old woman, who couldn&#x27;t listen very well understood <em>My name is Tere.</em> (Mi nombre es Tere). The old woman didn&#x27;t want her unexpected guest to get wet in the rain so she invited her to come in. Death tried to explain her true intention but the old woman would not let her speak with her constant stream of attentions.</p>
<p>Death felt warm, nobody had welcomed her with such a genuine appreciation. The old lady even gave her a bed, a pillow and some blankets to keep her warm and prevent her from getting sick. Well into the night the old lady sang death a lullaby and death quickly fell asleep. They both enjoyed each others company so death decided to stay for several days to play chess, cook and have long talks by the fireplace. However death was very busy and she couldn&#x27;t stay forever, so one day she said goodbye to the old lady.</p>
<p>The old woman told death that she understood her departure, but asked if she would grant her one more day of company so that she would have someone to celebrate her birthday with. Death accepted and in the morning the old woman prepared a giant cake, it was so big that death said that it may be big enough to hold a hundred candles. The old woman laughed and said that even though the cake would not hold so many the house would, and she dedicated herself to putting 100 candles arround the house. The old woman felt very happy by the company, the cake and the warm light of a hundred candles.</p>
<p>But what really made her the happiest person was the beautiful dress that death had made for her, it was to much joy that the old woman decidad to dance for a little bit, something she couldn&#x27;t even remember the last time she had done it. In the end death got up ready to leave but sang <em>Las Ma√±anitas</em> one last time before her departure and the old woman began to extinguish her hundred candles, but she got short of breath and couldn&#x27;t extinguish the last one. The old woman tired from dancing and blowing out candles went to sleep, death took her things but just before leaving she went to the old woman and blew out the last candle on her bureau. That is the story of the old woman who died on a late spring day.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
