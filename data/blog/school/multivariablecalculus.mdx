# Introduction

**Reference systems**

The spherical coordinates are given by the orderly triad (Rho, Phi, Theta) or (Rho, Theta, Phi). Where (Rho) is the distance to the origin, (Theta) is the angle between the projection of (Rho) in XY and the axis X positive, (PHI) is the angle between (Rho) and (Z). Here (Z) is equal to (Rho) for the cosine of (PHI).

Put image here for clarity

The **plane** Cartesian or Euclidean is the set of points (x, y) where both are real numbers. It is represented by two orthogonal lines that intersect at the origin.

- The X is the ABCISA to the point. The Y is the orderly to the point.

**Euclidean space** is the set of points (X, Y, Z) where the three components or variables are real. It is represented by three orthogonal straights. If any component is 0 the space becomes a plane indicated by two axes.

- (0, B, c) = plane YZ
- (A, 0, c) = plane xz
- (A, B, 0) = Flat XY

**Cylindrical coordinates** are denoted by (R, Theta, Z). Where (R) is the distance to the origin over XY, (Z) is the height and (theta) is the angle from the positive x axis.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Cylindrical to Rectangular}\\
	x = (r)(\cos(\theta)) \qquad y = (r)(\sin(\theta)) \qquad z = z \\
	\text{Rectangular to Cylindrical}\\
	r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \qquad \theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}) \qquad z = z
	\text{From spherical to rectangular}\\
	x = (\rho)(\sin(\phi))(\cos(\theta)) \quad y = (\rho)(\sin(\phi))(\sin(\theta)) \quad z = (\rho)(\cos(\phi)) \\
	\text{From rectangular to spherical}\\
	\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \quad \theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x}) \quad \phi = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\right)\\
	\text{From spherical to cylindrical}\\
	r = \sqrt{(\rho^2)(\sin^2(\phi))} \quad \theta = \theta \quad z = (\rho)(\cos(\phi))\\
	\text{From cylindrical to spherical}\\
	p = \sqrt{r^2 + z^2} \quad \theta = \theta \quad \phi = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{r^2 + z^2}}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

**Domain** of a function is the possible set of obtained numbers that depend on the variable or independent variables.

A variable N function ** is a correspondence where the variable dependent is determined by one or more independent variables.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Function of n variables}\\
	y = f(x_1, x_2)\\
	\text{Function of 2 variables}\\
	f(x,y) = x + y^2
\end{gathered}
$$

Ejemplos:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	f(x,y) = \sqrt{y-x^2} \quad D = \{(x,y)|y-x^2 \geq 0\} \quad y = x^2 \quad R = \{z| z \geq 0\}\\
	f(x,y) = \frac{1}{xy} \quad D = \{(x,y)| x \neq 0 \land y \neq 0 \} \quad R = \{z | z \neq 0 \}\\
	f(x,y) = \sin(xy) \quad D = \{(x,y) | (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}\} \quad R = \{z | 0 \leq z \leq 1 \}\\
	f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \quad D = \{(x,y,z)| f \in \mathbb{R} \} \quad R = \{f | f \geq 0 \}\\
	f(x, y, z) = (x)(y)(\ln(z)) \quad D = \{(x,y,z)| z > 0 \}\\
	f(x,y) = \frac{\log(x^2-2x-15)(4-y^2)}{x^3} \quad D = \{(x,y)| x < -3 \cup x > 5 \} \}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Graph** of a two-variable function tends to be a surface in space.

The contour lines or **level curves** of the three-time figure are obtained by clipping horizontally. If the function is given by $z = F(x,y)$ then $z = k$ is the equation for the points of the cut. For different values of k we obtain the curves at different levels. If the curves are closer means a more pronounced K slope.

The level map is built by graphing at the X and the level curves. 

- Ideal gases law
- Van der Walls Law
- Electric potential

For example:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	f(x,y) = xy \quad k = xy \quad y = \frac{k}{x}\\
\end{gathered}
$$
