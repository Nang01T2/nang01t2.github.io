philosophical dialogue written around 385 BCE that depicts the evening party (416 BCE) of Agathon, a tragic poet who was celebrating his triumph on Athens&#x27; annual drama competition. While drinking guests began exchanging their opinions about Eros or Love. Symposiums, or their smaller symposia, where drinking social gatherings of high status males who wore garlands and reclined on long couches while being served wine by slave boys after their meal. Guests were expected to dance, sing, recite poetry or even rhetoric but not to enter into a rigorous philosophical debate like the text implies.</p><p>It is notable the care Plato took in showing that the political and military scandals of Alcibiades, a once prominent disciple of Socrates, where caused by Alcibiades himself and not related to Socrates teachings. Alcibiades had been accused of mutilating Athens protective statues and mocking the sacred rites performed before the invasion of Sicily, we don&#x27;t know if the claims are true but shortly after Athenians recalled him to stand trial he defected to Sparta. Later on he was pardoned and recalled again to serve as fleet commander, however after several defeats he was once again recalled from the battlefield but died abroad, murdered at the hands of his political enemies. Critics of Socrates would often cite Alcibiades actions, while his followers like Xenophon or Plato would try to clear his reputation.</p><hr/><h1 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Introduction</a></h1><p>Apollodorus walks from his house in Phalerum to Athens when his friend Glaucon stops him, Glaucon wants to know about the speeches given in Agathon&#x27;s party. Phoenix, Philip’s son, told someone and that someone told Glaucon about them, he simply wanted to confirm the story with Apollodorus who knew Socrates, one of the guests. Apollodorus told Glaucon that unfortunately he was not present, the banquet took place many years ago, so many in fact that even Agathon lived somewhere else. The man who told Apollodorus was Aristodemus, another guest, and he was also the one who told Phoenix. Apollodorus later confirmed Aristodemus story with Socrates whom he had known for the past three years. Next is what Aristodemus from Cydathenaeum told Apollodorus.</p><p>I found out about the party when I saw Socrates walking to Agathon&#x27;s house. Socrates was bathed and wearing his best sandals, and asked me if I would accompany him. I was worried of appearing uninvited but Socrates said that they would device a reasonable excuse. Upon arriving Socrates fell behind engrossed in thought, I didn&#x27;t want to disturb him so I continued. When I entered Agathon&#x27;s house one of his servants guided me into the main room.</p><p>Agathon saw me and apologized that I hadn&#x27;t received an invitation but I was nowhere to be found. Agathon then sent his servants to fetch Socrates, but I recommended that it was best if we started eating. Halfway through dinner Socrates entered, and Agathon told him to seat besides him to absorb his wisdom. Socrates told him that if that was true then he would also want to sit next to him to absorb his talents. After the meal we offered libations and sang to Dionysus. Pausanias wanted to go easy on the wine.</p><p>Everybody accepted Pausanias suggestion since many still had a hang over from the previous night. Eryximachus told us that in his practice he had seen how dangerous getting drunk can be to humans. He also told everybody to ignore the flute girl and the women so that they could converse better. He wanted the topic of conversation to start based on observations made by Phaedrus: Why do poets and sophists write hymns and psalms to every god except Eros? I have even read a book praising salt but not a single one about Eros! And this is how each of the guests gave a speech about Eros.</p><hr/><h1 id="phaedrus"><a href="#phaedrus" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Phaedrus</a></h1><p><em>Athenian aristocrat, friend of Socrates.</em></p><p>Eros is the most useful force for both humans and gods alike. He is the oldest god. First was Chaos, then Earth and then Eros, who wanted to help the human race. Eros inspires courage and the desire of a better life, there are no greater gifts for youth. It makes us honorable because we fear not being worthy in the eyes of the one we love. If politicians or soldiers were motivated by love they would be unstoppable.</p><p>Homer mentions this <em>love madness</em> as the only way a person can become a true hero. Both men and woman are capable of fighting to their death for the one they really love. Love doesn&#x27;t happen at the same time, one loves first and then the other more bravely accepts. Love is how we can experiment the divine and it will give us happiness in life and in death.</p><blockquote><p>Love is ancient, divine, it motivates us, inspires courage and honor, makes us vulnerable and brave at the same time, makes us happy.</p></blockquote><hr/><h1 id="pausanias"><a href="#pausanias" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Pausanias</a></h1><p><em>Legal expert.</em></p><p>Eros is actually two gods, Pandemon Eros and Heavenly Eros. One comes from Aphrodite of Ouranos and the other from Aphrodite of Zeus and Dione. The intention and circumstances of an action dictate if it is good or bad in nature. Begging, swearing, submitting or even sleeping on a door mat are justified by noble love. Noble love appears on older men seeking boys (first hints of a beard) to impart them virtue. Noble love makes it impossible to take advantage, humiliate or betray the trust of the loved one.</p><p>Secret love can&#x27;t be noble, it must happen honestly and in the open. Sex when done with decorum, respect, good intentions and with a good person cannot be shameful. With respect to Eros legislation Elis and Boetia don&#x27;t regulate, Ionia regulates it too much, Athens and Lacedaemon are in the middle. Also fathers should not prohibit love in their children, since love by itself is not bad. As the Athenian saying goes: <em>To love or to be loved is a thing of honor</em>.</p><p>Love can be bad if comes from the search of beauty, money, power, influence, fear or lust. It is good if it appears in the search of immutable things like character, soul or virtue. Don&#x27;t give yourself to love too quickly, you need to examine first if it is good or bad love. In short, heavenly love comes from seeking excellence and honor and acquiring eternal things. And that is very valuable to a society like Athens because it induces virtue on its citizens.</p><blockquote><p>Love can be divine or mundane. Mundane love is done in secret, it desires money, power, fear or lust. Be cautions of mundane love.

I agree that Love is duality, but as a medic I believe it originates in body and in soul. Love can be biological in origin, animals, plants and every living thing is capable of love. In the body bad and good love manifest as healthy and unhealthy desire.</p><p><em>&quot;An unhealthy love is one between two people who love dissimilar things and in dissimilar ways&quot;.</em> Medicine is the skill of sorting out the good from the bad body desires Once identified to heal is to find equilibrium in the dualities that exist in our bodies. Asclepius, the first doctor, healed by bringing peace between two opposing forces in the body. Also love permeates everything men do, gymnastics, agriculture, music, astronomy etc.</p><p>Heracleitus says love is the harmony in opposites by taking advantage of their differences. For example, two different instruments that need to be in harmony to sound good. To achieve this they can&#x27;t play individually, in the end their sum is better that their parts. <em>&quot;Music is the skill that concerns itself with the harmony and rhythm of matters to do with love.&quot;</em></p><p>To find noble love we first need to identify if it is bringing harmony into the world. Bad love can therefore be recognized as the desire for excess, greed and selfishness. Even divinations are noble love since they bring harmony by communicating mortals and immortals. Finally, the greatest love procures justice, temperance, friendships, and divinity.</p><blockquote><p>Love is universal, harmonious, it is equilibrium, a healthy desire, it is part of our bodies and souls. Bad love comes from a place of greed, excess and selfishness. Good love procures justice, temperance, friendships and divinity.</p></blockquote><hr/><h1 id="aristophanes"><a href="#aristophanes" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Aristophanes</a></h1><p><em>Comic playwright</em></p><p><em>“It makes me wonder if love is what I needed instead of sneezing to restore my balance&quot;</em> Aristophanes starts with the previous joke and points out that his speech may be laughable.Eros is the most powerful and philanthropic god since it heals our body and soul. Initially there were three genders: Male, female and hermaphrodite. Now we use the term as an insult, but back then hermaphrodites were common. Men had a round shape, with four hands, four legs, two faces, two genitalia etc.</p><p>Humans could walk forwards or backwards, with our four limbs or by rolling. Men were children of the sun, females came from the earth and hermaphrodites from the moon. Men had formidable strength and power, so they climbed the sky and attacked the gods. Zeus didn&#x27;t want to destroy them, so instead he cut us in half, and threaten to cut us again. Apollo put our skin on its place and knotted everything in the belly button, like a purse.</p><p>Once Zeus did this, each half longed for its other half, and threw at each other arms. Zeus saw that his plan had backfired since humans preferred to die holding tightly than drink. So Zeus decided that humans could become one but just for an instant when they had sex. This way they could multiply and also temporarily satisfy their desire for each other. Those who came from the androgynous half desire their opposite sex and are naturally unfaithful.</p><p>Those who came out of the female lust for women, those who came out of the male lust for males. Homosexuals are more virile and brave, they make fine politicians and are naturally faithful. This is logical since they don&#x27;t have to wrestle with marriage or children. Eros is the impossible human desire to become eternally bound with another person.</p><blockquote><p>Love is the innate human desire to become whole again by finding our missing half.</p></blockquote><hr/><h1 id="agathon"><a href="#agathon" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Agathon</a></h1><p><em>Tragic poet, host of the banquet.</em></p><p>Socrates told Eryximachus that talking after a great orator like Agathon was panic inducing. Agathon then replied that Socrates was trying to distract him with all his flattery. Socrates replied that if a few friends distracted him then acting must have been dreadful. Agathon replied that it is more frightening talking to a few wise friends that to a crowd. Socrates concluded that Agathon argument didn&#x27;t made sense since everybody was in that crowd.</p><p>Earlier speakers praise Eros and the benefits it provides but not what it really is. He is the most beautiful and the youngest, he escapes in old age. <em>&quot;Like clings to like!&quot;.</em> He is the most tender, soft, he is not body or soul but something more sublime. He is the most agile, he enters the body of tender souls and can exit them easily. He is the god of elegance, grace and beauty. He cannot be controlled in any way known.</p><p>Our law stablishes that if something is agreed voluntarily it is lawful and therefore just. Therefore Eros is also just, since we all enter into his spell voluntarily. Eros is prudence and moderation, it allows humans to regulate our primal sexual desires. He is more brave than Ares, and the wisest since just a whisper from him turns a man into a poet. Even gods turn to Eros to become masters in their respective fields, mastery comes from love.</p><p>He is the god of peace, friendships, feasts, dances and every sacrifice made. He is patron of the refined, delicate, sensuous, passionate and caring. <em>&quot;He gives peace to mankind, calms the oceans, stills the winds and bids the sufferer some sleep.&quot;</em></p><blockquote><p>Love is beautiful, young, sublime, tender, agile, just. Love makes us brave, wise and prudent at the same time. Love is peace, friends, dances and feasts. Love is what drives us to be passionate and caring.</p></blockquote><hr/><h1 id="socrates"><a href="#socrates" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Socrates</a></h1><p><em>Eminent philosopher and Plato&#x27;s teacher.</em></p><p>I&#x27;m left speechless after such a glorious speech by Agathon. I was a fool to agree to speak about Eros since I can&#x27;t make speeches like yours. However since you focused on praising Eros I&#x27;ll instead tell you the <em>truth</em> behind him. Everybody gave Socrates permission to speak as he pleased. And he started using his teaching method.</p><p>If you love, then you love something and you naturally desire it. If you desire something it&#x27;s because you lack it or want to avoid losing it. Then love is the desire to have something worthy right now and forever. Eros is our desire to change what is wrong into something good or beautiful. I arrived at this truth after speaking with Diotima of Mantinea. She was a really wise woman, once she made a sacrifice that averted a plague for 10 years, and she told me the following points.</p><p>Love is good and bad, wise and ignorant, beautiful and ugly at the same time. Love is not even a god, it is something between a mortal and an immortal being. Love is the spirit in charge of interpreting desires and getting them closer to reality. They say all poetry is an act of creation, but in reality all creation is an act of poetry. Every miracle, divination, sacrifice and magic in the world passes through Eros.</p><p>The most ignorant person is the one that stops desiring to acquire better knowledge. Humans desire good or virtuous things because that&#x27;s the only path to happiness. Love is not about wholes or halves, is about desiring something virtuous. You don&#x27;t love what praises you, you love what simply makes you better.</p><p>Eros was born the same day as Aphrodite, his father is Poros and his mother Metis. Poros is the god of riches and Metis is the god of poverty. hence his duality. Metis wanting a better life for her son impregnated herself while Poros was drunk. Eros became the poorest god but also the most skillful in obtaining what he desired. Eros can be the bravest, or wisest of them all if that gets him closer to his goals. However the great powers he posses can disappear as quickly as they appear.</p><p>When men finally posses what they desire they can give birth to beauty in their bodies or souls. We love because we fear that what we are perpetuating to the world is not good. So love is at its root a divine act of creation, of desiring good and giving it back. And that desire comes from the deepest human desire of making things that endure. Since we are mortal beings, immortality can only be achieved through acts of love.</p><p>Every human is unique, time may change their bodies and souls but the being remains the same. You grow old and your body, hair, flesh, bones and blood changes. But you are still yourself. Your very soul, habits, temper, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains and fears change. Even your memories, each and every single thought changes as we forget or recollect. You can preserve a part of you only through love, by bringing in new good things into the world.</p><p>To preserve you soul focus on poetry, harmony, family, politics, moderation and justice. As you grow wiser what you want to immortalize or love also changes in a natural progression. Love of material goods, one body, all bodies, soul, good values, ethics, institutions. Later you seek to preserve science, truth, knowledge, philosophy and wisdom. Finally you will realize that the purest thing to love is life itself, nature and yourself.</p><blockquote><p>Love is the desire to replace bad things with good things. Love is an act of creation, of poetry, of wanting to bring something worthy into this world. Love is the only way to achieve immortality, it is what drives us to leave a part of ourselves behind, and what part you want to leave changes as you grow older. At first is material things, then it may be knowledge but in the end the purest love comes from loving yourself, your very existence and the miracle of nature.</p></blockquote><hr/><h1 id="alcibiades"><a href="#alcibiades" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Alcibiades</a></h1><p><em>Athenian handsome statesman and general.</em></p><p>Alcibiades entered after Socrates speech completely drunk and accompanied by a flute girl. He sits between Socrates and Agathon complaining that Socrates is too preachy Socrates asked Agathon for protection since he loved Alcibiades but he was prone to violence. Now I&#x27;m master of drinks and I order everyone to be as drunk as me. Eryximachus told Alcibiades that everybody had made a praise to Eros, so it was his turn.</p><p>I can&#x27;t praise any men or god in front of Socrates or he might hit me out of jealousy. So everybody, including Socrates, agreed that he then praised Socrates himself. Socrates is like a Silenus statue, ugly on the outside but with beautiful figurines on the inside. He is like a satyr, like Marsyas, he insults people and then enchants them with his flute. In this case his flute are his words, his philosophy, he has a god like power of speech.</p><p>Even the most achieved orators in can&#x27;t make my heart dance like he does when he speaks. Socrates words make my soul enter a turmoil, I feel humiliated, like a slave in his presence. I prefer to ignore him or else I would destroy myself trying to amend my multiple imperfections. When I was his student I tried to be his lover, staying with him alone as much as possible. I even did some contact sports like wrestling hoping that the physical contact would charm him.</p><p>After my failed attempts I invited him to dinner and talked passed midnight. Then I told him that it was too late so he should spend the night in my room. I couldn&#x27;t hold it any longer and I confessed then and there my love to him, but he rejected me. My last attempt was to put a coat over him and then slept with my arms around him. He demonstrated to be a master of self control by rejecting my objectively physical beauty.</p><p>He had bitten my heart like a snake and now my worst scars are the ones left by his words. I had fallen into his trap like Charmides, Euthydemus, Diocles&#x27;s son and now maybe even Agathon. He later accompanied me to my campaigns and demonstrated unnatural strength in many aspects. He didn&#x27;t seem to mind the cold, heat, hunger, thirst, or lack of sleep. He saved my life bravely, and when we where in full retreat he never succumbed to panic. Socrates is so unique that there is no ancient or contemporary person we can compare him to.</p><p>After Alcibiades finished his speech everybody laughed because they could all see that Alcibiades was still pretty much in love with Socrates and ashamed that he had been rejected. Socrates told Alcibiades that it was apparent that he was jealous of his relationship with Agathon, and that he wanted Agathon for himself, then to add insult to injury Socrates told everybody that now he would praise Agathon just like Alcibiades had praised him.</p><p>A lot of new people entered the room, Eryximachus, Phaedrus and others left soon after, Aristodemus decided to stay and sleep. When he woke up in the morning he found Socrates still arguing with Agathon and Aristophanes on how a great comedian could easily become a great tragedian and vice versa. Aristodemus watched as Agathon and Aristophanes fell asleep and Socrates got up and left. Aristodemus then followed Socrates to Lyceum where he washed and did his daily activities until the evening when he finally went home to get some rest.</p></div><!--/$--></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"toc":[{"value":"Introduction","url":"#introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Phaedrus","url":"#phaedrus","depth":1},{"value":"Pausanias","url":"#pausanias","depth":1},{"value":"Eryximachus","url":"#eryximachus","depth":1},{"value":"Aristophanes","url":"#aristophanes","depth":1},{"value":"Agathon","url":"#agathon","depth":1},{"value":"Socrates","url":"#socrates","depth":1},{"value":"Alcibiades","url":"#alcibiades","depth":1}],"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    div: \"div\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    hr: \"hr\",\n    h1: \"h1\",\n    em: \"em\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Image} = _components;\n  if (!Image) _missingMdxReference(\"Image\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.div, {\n      children: _jsx(Image, {\n        alt: \"Anselm Feuerbach 1868\",\n        src: \"/static/images/history/Feuerbach_symposium.jpg\",\n        width: \"1280\",\n        height: \"621\"\n      })\n    }), _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"The \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://philarchive.org/archive/FREAR-4#:~:text=Dover%20'The%20date%20of%20Plato's,as%20eros%20here%2C%20see%20Glossary.\",\n        children: \"Symposium\"\n      }), \" by Plato is a philosophical dialogue written around 385 BCE that depicts the evening party (416 BCE) of Agathon, a tragic poet who was celebrating his triumph on Athens' annual drama competition.
