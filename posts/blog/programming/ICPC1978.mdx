Problem 1 - LARGE INTEGERS

Your program is to read a card containing two non-negative integers (not both zero), print their sum on a double spaced line, and continue in this fashion until the deck terminator, a blank card, is encountered. On each card, one integer is contained somewhere in the first forty columns and the other is somewhere in the latter forty. Non-trailing zeroes may appear as blanks and the values of the integer data may exceed the capacity of an integer variable. The sum is to be printed without leading zeroes, right-justified at column 50, and with commas separating each group of three digits starting at the right.

For example the card:

* 05016523892 (first 40) + 673519440 (latter 40)
* 11,740,043,332 (double spaced right justified at 50)

```python
```

```bash
RIGHT JUSTIFIED MEANS TO THE LEFT

Problem 2 - VIRTUAL BRICK WALLS

When building a brick wall it is essential to purchase enough material. If bricks of various sizes are used an interesting simulation of the "virtual wall" can be made to determine the number of bricks needed. For this problem you are given the size of the wall and the number of each type of bricks available. You are to determine if the desired wall can be constructed from these bricks and what its courses (rows) can look like.

Input: A sequence of data cards, format 5I5 (FORTRAN 5 integers with 5 field width), terminated by a black card. Each card describes a wall building problem as follows:

1. Width of wall in units &lt;= 20
2. Number of courses (rows of bricks) needed &lt;= 12
3. Number of Type 3 Bricks available
4. Number of Type 2 Bricks available
5. Number of Type 1 Bricks available

Bricks of Type 3 are 3 units wide, bricks of type 2 are 2 units wide and bricks of type 1 are 1 unit wide. Bricks are always to be laid flat, never placed on edge or end.

Output: For each wall-building problem on a separate page, either print only the message `CAN'T BE DONE` if the bricks supplied cannot build the wall requested; or if it can be done print a picture of the wall as described below. Print pictures of bricks in the following sizes:

```bash
Type 3 (18)
******************
*                *
*                *
******************
Type 2 (12)
************
*          *
*          *
************
Type 1 (6)
******
*    *
*    *
******
```

So that the set of problem data consisting of: 5 3 4 2 6. has as one of its correct responses the picture:

```bash
******************************
*                **          *
*                **          *
******************************
******************************
*          **                *
*          **                *
******************************
******************************
*    **                **    *
*    **                **    *
******************************
```

Zero in the first field of a card indicate the termination of the data deck and hence the problems.

```python
```

```bash

```

Problem 3 - SECURITY CODES

To insure the correctness of frequently used codes, a sequence of check digits can be systematically embedded with each usage. For example, a particular security code algorithm could use the sum of all digits modulo 26 and the corresponding character of the alphabet attached to the end. In such a case 57359 would require the check character 'D' because 5+7+3+5+9=29 modulo 26 equals 3 which indexes the fourth letter in the alphabet or 'D' (A being 0). There are reasonably sophisticated variations of the scheme in wide use today in credit cards, security codes and passwords.

The inverse of this process is to break such a coding scheme given enough information. For this problem you are given a particular check digit coding scheme to break. This specific scheme uses the summation from left to right with either addition, subtraction or multiplication among adjacent digits. You also know that each digit is used once and only once in the algorithm. Given a set of five digit codes followerd by a single alphanumeric character, write a program to break this code.

The input will be 10 sets of six character fields as examples of the code on a single card in columns 1 thru 60 respectively. This will be followed by a second card with 10 sets of five digit fields in columns 1 thru 50 respectively. You are to determine the check digit code algorithm and provide the check characters. Print out the initial sequences, the check digit algorithm you have determined as in A+B+C+D+E in the initial example, and the new sets of codes you have created using this algorithm

```python
```

```bash

Problem 4 - KNIGHT'S TOUR SIMULATION

Given an n x n chessboard, a Knight's Tour is the series of moves whereby each square is 'visited' once and only once by a piece performing legal (chess) Knight moves. In the following diagram, the Knight (K) can move to any of the squares numbered 1 through 8 (N = 5).

```bash
---------------------
|   | 8 |   | 1 |   |
---------------------
| 7 |   |   |   | 2 |
---------------------
|   |   | K |   |   |
---------------------
| 6 |   |   |   | 3 |
---------------------
|   | 5 |   | 4 |   |
---------------------
```

Obviously a Knight near an edge or corner of the board has fewer potential moves available. This problem requires the generation of one of the correct Knight's tours on a 5 x 5 board. The initial starting location for each game will be provided as a set of integers (i, j) where i is right justified in column 1 and j is right justified in column 2. A zero in column 1 and 2 indicates a termination of the problem.

Output should be a 5 x 5 integer array of numbers representing the moves from square to square. Also, the output should be followed by the word 'OPEN' or the word 'CLOSED' (a closed Knight's tour is where the starting and ending positions are a Knight's move apart; otherwise the tour is open) as appropriate.

Sample input might be 33 with one of the possible outputs:

```bash
--------------------------
| 25 |  8 |  3 | 14 | 19 |
--------------------------
|  2 | 13 | 18 |  9 |  4 |
--------------------------
|  7 | 24 |  1 | 20 | 15 |
--------------------------
| 12 | 17 | 22 |  5 | 10 |
--------------------------
| 23 |  6 | 11 | 16 | 21 |
--------------------------
OPEN
```

**TEXAS REGIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST - April 6, 1974**

Upper Division - Problem 2

This problem requires that you write a program which does three tasks which might facilitate the use of a communication line. The first task is that of translating from one set of codes to another. The second task is to compress 80 character card images to a smaller size by compressing blanks. The final task is that of grouping these "compressed" records into larger records. The three tasks are to be performed in sequence.

Your program will have one control card which will be followed by an arbitrary number of data cards. The last card will have asterisks in columns 1 - 4. The control card will have the following format:

| Columns | Contents |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 - 4 | N, the length of the "new" records, N&lt;1000 |
| 6 - 7 | M, the number of characters to be translated, M&lt;=20 |
| 10 - (9 + M) | The M distinct characters to be translated |
| 40 - (39 + M) | The M characters to which the first M characters are to be translated |

For example, a control card containing `0400 03 ABC $,$` means that the program is to produce 400 character records that all the A's and C's are to be converted to '$' and B's are to be converted to ','.

Characters which appear on the data cards but not on the translate list will be unaffected. Compression is effected by replacing each string of 4 or more blanks by an ampersand, '&', followed by two digits containing the number of blanks. Thus, the compressed form of a translated card containing ABC in columns 10 - 12 and nothing else would be: '&09ABC&68'.

Finally, after translation and compression have taken place the records should be grouped into 'new' records of length N by concatenating compressed records until the 'new' record is full. No compressed record should be split between two 'new' records whenever it is impossible to add an additional compressed record to a 'new' record, then the remainder of the 'new' record should be filled with blanks.

Advance to a new page and write out the 'new' records on the printer, double spaced, using as many lines as necessary to represent each records in columns 10 - 109 of each line. No extra blank lines between records are needed.

```python
translationCards = [
	"0400 05  ABCDG                         $,$X?                         ",

**TEXAS REGIONAL PROGRAMMING CONTEST - April 6, 1974**

Upper Division - Problem 3

Suppose there are n ducks floating on the pond in a circle. The pond is also home for an alligator with a fondness for ducks. Beginning at a particular position (duck number 1) the alligator counts around the circle and eats every m th duck (the circle closing as ducks are eaten). For example, when n = 8 and m = 4, the circle would update as: 

1. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] = 1-2-3-4
2. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] = 5-6-7-8
3. [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7] = 1-2-3-5
4. [1, 2, 3, 6, 7] = 6-7-1-2
5. [1, 3, 6, 7] = 3-6-7-1
6. [3, 6, 7] = 3-6-7-3
7. [6, 7] = 6-7-6-7
8. [6] = 6-6-6-6
9. [] = END

The first duck is fifth on the menu, the second is fourth, etc. The sequence 5 4 6 1 3 8 7 2 of orders of consumption completely describes the alligator's menu. Write a program which prints out the orders of consumption of the ducks given n and m on an input card in the following format:

* 2 - 3 n
* 5 - 6 m

There may be multiple input cards. Neither n nor m will be zero. A blank card marks the end of the data. The output should begin on a new page at the left side line, use 3 columns for each integer, and continue on subsequent lines as needed. Double space between the output produced by the individual cases and begin again at the left of the printed line each time.

FREE-FORM INPUT

You are to read a set of data cards and, for each data card, compute the sum of the numbers on that card. Each card contains 1 or more numbers in columns 1 - 72. Numbers are separated by commas. A number may be positive or negative (preceded by a minus sign), and may or may not contain a decimal part. Blanks may be imbedded between numbers and within numbers. An example: (1   23.4 , -5  ,  .00 2, 1 8 6   ). The numbers on this card are 123.4, -5, 0.002 and 186.

The output for each card should consist of the card itself and the resulting sum, e.g., 

* CARD = 1   23.4 , -5  ,  .00 2, 1 8 6   
* SUM = 304.402000000

You may use a F20.9 format ([FORTRAN format FMT](https://eml.berkeley.edu/sst/fmttop.html)) for the sum. The program should halt when a card containing all blanks in columns 1 - 72 is encountered.

1. You may assume correct input.
2. You may assume that all values can be represented as standard real numbers.
3. You need not worry about the precision of fractional numbers; 0.1 cannot be represented exactly but the internal representation will be accepted as correct.

```python
numberDataCards = [
	"1   23.4 , -5  ,  .00 2, 1 8 6                                          ",
	"1   23.4 , -5  ,  .00 2, 0.000000001,   2.00 03   5   6, 156    3.000013",
	"                                                                        ",

		for number in numbersFromCard:

TRIANGULAR TEXT

Write a program which will read a text file and print the text in a triangle. The rows of the triangle are to be single spaced and left justified. The last row of the triangle is to contain one word. Periods are to be included with the final word of each sentence and are the only type of punctuation in the input text. Each row of the triangle is to contain the minimum number of words needed in order to make that row longer than the row below. Any excess words are to be placed in the first row. The text contains at most 400 characters. Each input record is in FORMAT(80A1) (80 single char byte string), no extra blanks appear between words or before the first word, and no word is split across cards. The end of input is indicated by a blank record. An example of input and output follows:
