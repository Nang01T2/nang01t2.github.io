# PN Union

The utility of semiconductors arises by putting two P-type and N-type semiconductors in contact to form a ** PN junction **. At the point of contact, a ** Metallurgical Union ** is created, where there is a large concentration differential, which is why a current begins by diffusion of both holes and electrons. The currents by diffusion recombine the holes with the electrons, exposing the static donor and acceptor ions of both types, that is, two charged regions are created and the difference in charges in turn creates an electric field in the region with positive ions at the region with negative ions. We call ** Region of Depletion ** the region of positive and negative static charges that appears after the initial contact.

If no voltage is applied, the diffusion eventually stops, that is, the strength of the electric field ends up equal to the force due to diffusion. This ** Equilibrium ** arises since for each majority carrier that manages to spread at the same time, a minority carrier manages to be driven by the field in the opposite direction. In other words, the diffusion current equals the entrainment current, both small. The induced electric field in the depletion region gives rise to a potential difference called the built-in potential barrier or ** Built-in Voltage ** and is calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_{bi} = \frac{kT}{e} ln(\frac{N\_a N\_d}{n\_i^2}) = V\_T ln(\frac{N\_a N\_d}{n\_i^2})\\
	V\_T \text{ = Voltaje Térmico a Temp. Ambiente} \approx 0.026V\\
	\text{k = Constante de Boltzmann}\\
	\text{e = Carga del electrón}\\
	N\_a\text{ = Concentración de Aceptores}\\
	N\_d\text{ = Concentración de Donadores}\\
	n\_i\text{ = Concentración Intrínseca}
\end{gathered}
$$

For example, the incorporated voltage of a pn junction of a silicon crystal at T = 300K doped with concentrations of N_a = 10 16 and N_d = 10 17 is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_{bi} = V\_T ln(\frac{N\_a N\_d}{n\_i^2})\\
	V\_{bi} = (0.026) ln(\frac{(10^{16})(10^{17})}{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}) = 0.757 V
\end{gathered}
$$

The built-in voltage cannot be measured with a multimeter since, when making contact with the tips, new potential barriers are formed and these barriers are balanced by diffusion with the tips, preventing a measurement from being taken. In essence, this region is always in equilibrium, so although it has voltage, this pn junction no longer produces current, however this barrier is important if we apply an external voltage.

# Inverse Polarization

If we apply a positive voltage to region n (**Reverse Polarization**) we are introducing another additional electric field whose direction is the same as the field of the depletion region. Let us remember that the field of the depletion region is the one that prevents diffusion by repelling the majority charges. This additional field repels even more carriers and moves them away from the depletion region by increasing their size. The most important thing is that by increasing the size of the depletion region, the diffusion current decreases, we are practically **preventing** the existence of a conventional diffusion current from the P region to the N region. there is a current by drag (**Reverse Saturation Current**) from the N region to the P region, however since this current is caused by thermal generation it does not depend on the applied voltage and we consider it constant.

**Capacitors** are devices that store charge by maintaining an electric field between two charged plates separated by a dielectric insulator. The plates are charged by applying a voltage that maintains their excess carriers.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	C = \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}\\
	\text{C = Capacitancia}\\
	\text{A = Area de las placas}\\
	\varepsilon \text{ = Permitividad del medio entre ellas}\\
	\text{d = Distancia entre las pkacas}
\end{gathered}
$$

When we apply a reverse bias voltage, the growth of the depletion region causes it to act as the dielectric insulator, turning the diode into a capacitor with the only difference that any increase in voltage continues to increase the depletion region, separating the plates. (P region and N region) and therefore decreasing its transition capacitance. When we apply a direct voltage, the depletion region decreases so it cannot act by itself as a dielectric insulator, however when the current increases the excess of minority carriers near the junction also increases, these minority carriers generate a diffusion capacitance . Diffusion capacitance increases with current as this increases excess minority carriers. The transition or junction capacitance is calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	C\_j = C\_{jo} \left( 1 + \frac{V\_R}{V\_{bi}} \right)^{-1/2} \\
	C\_{jo} \text{ = Capacitancia sin voltaje aplicado}\\
	V\_R \text{ = Voltaje de polarizacion inversa}\\
	V\_{bi} \text{ = Voltaje incorporado}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the diode has no-voltage applied capacitance given the instrinsic charge difference in the depletion region and that the value of (n = 1/2) is used only for uniform initial doping. Thanks to the relationship between capacitance and applied voltage, pn junctions can be manufactured that vary their capacitance as a function of inverse voltage and are called **Varicap Diodes** (Varactor Diodes), these diodes are used as capacitors instead of rectifiers in circuits of electrical resonance such as the Hartley oscillator.

For example, the capacitance of a silicon pn junction at $T = 300K$ with doping concentrations of $ N_a = 10 16 and $ N_d = 10 15 with an intrinsic concentration of $ n_i = 1.5 \ times 10 ^ {10} $, an applied voltage-free capacitance of $ C_{jo} = 0.5pF $ at an applied voltage of 1V and 5V is:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_{bi} = V\_T ln(\frac{N\_a N\_d}{n\_i^2})\\
	V\_{bi} = (0.026) ln(\frac{(10^{16})(10^{15})}{(1.5 \times 10^{10})^2}) = 0.637 V\\
	C\_j = C\_{jo} \left( 1 + \frac{V\_R}{V\_{bi}} \right)^{-1/2} \\
	C\_j = (0.5) \left( 1 + \frac{1}{0.637} \right)^{-1/2} = 0.312pF \\
	C\_j = (0.5) \left( 1 + \frac{5}{0.637} \right)^{-1/2} = 0.168pF 
\end{gathered}
$$

# Direct Polarization

If we apply a positive voltage to the p region (** Direct Polarization **) we generate an additional electric field in the opposite direction to the electric field of the depletion region. This additional field decreases the ability of the electric field in the depletion region to repel particles trying to pass through the region by diffusion. The most important thing is that by reducing the size of the depletion region ** we facilitate ** the passage of the current that could exist by diffusion. Stationary state is the process that achieves that the diffusion of carriers does not decrease as in gases thanks to the recombination process that prevents the carriers from diffusing at the ends of the semiconductor, so there will always be a concentration gradient. The current is calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	i\_D = I\_S \left( e^{(\frac{v\_D}{(n)(v\_T)})} - 1 \right) \\
	i\_D = \text{ = Corriente por Polarizacion Directa}\\
	I\_S = \text{ = Corriente por Saturacion}\\
	e = \text{ = Funcion Exponencial}\\
	v\_D = \text{ = Voltaje Directo Aplicado}\\
	v\_T = \text{ = Voltaje Termico}\\
	n = \text{ = Coeficiente de Emision}
\end{gathered}
$$

The Saturation Current in Silicon is typically between $ 10 -18 A $ to $ 10 -12 A $, it depends on the concentration of impurities, the contact area and especially on the temperature given its close relationship with generation and intrinsic concentration. It is called Reverse Saturation Current since it makes up almost all of the current in the semiconductor when the junction has a reverse bias. The ** Emission Coefficient ** or ideal factor is the recombination rate within the junction, when the current is very low the recombination rate can be an important factor and tends to 2, when the current is very high the coefficient of emission tends to 1. In most cases we consider that there is no recombination in the junction and the value is exactly 1. We call ** PN Junction Diode ** the device that regulates or rectifies the passage of current through a PN junction .

# Diode in a PN Union

The current generated by a direct polarization is an exponential function of the voltage, while in an indirect polarization the generated current tends to zero. For example, in an ideal diode with an $ I_S = 10-14 A $ and $ n = 1 $, the current increases an order of magnitude for each increase of $ 60mV $. The first use of the Junction Diode is for current rectification as a ** Switch ** with voltage dependent on and off.

Something to keep in mind in these diodes is that the saturation current and the thermal voltage depend on the ** Temperature **, in general the saturation current doubles for each increase of 5 ° C, that is why in germanium with a high intrinsic concentration is impractical given the high temperatures at which circuits normally operate. On the other hand, with the increase in temperature, the direct voltage necessary to generate the same current decreases.

An important effect of the reverse voltage is that if the voltage is strong enough (** Breakdown Voltage **), it will reach a point where the electric field of the depletion region will accelerate the carriers enough so that when they collide, they break covalent bonds. and multiply exponentially (** Avalanche Effect **) until the difference in concentrations generates a current by inverse polarization. This current once started is only limited by an external load without which the diode is likely to be destroyed due to the increase in thermal energy that arises when trying to dissipate a sudden increase in power.

A second type of breakdown is called ** Zener Breakdown ** and is due to the appearance of carriers in the junction due to the quantum tunneling effect, this effect is only noticeable when doping concentrations are extreme, the zener breakdown voltage tends to be less than 5V while the avalanche breakdown voltage is usually around 50V to 200V and even 1000V. Every manufactured junction is assigned a ** Peak Inverse Voltage PIV, which is the maximum voltage where it can be guaranteed that the avalanche effect will not occur. Diodes optimized to control current after breakdown voltage use zener breakdown and are therefore called ** Zener Diodes **.

![UnionPNTres](/static/images/electronica/UnionPNTres.png)

The diode has its utility as a switch so it is important to know its ** Transient Response ** or the time it takes to change from one state to another. Suppose we have a circuit with a direct applied voltage (Vf) and a resistance (Rf) that limits the current (If) that passes through the diode, so the diode will initially generate a current (Id) and will have a total voltage (Vd) which will depend on its built-in voltage (Vbi). At this point we can assume that the diode voltage (Vd) is close to the ** Cutoff Voltage ** because the potential barrier has been exceeded. As we saw in this state, the diode maintains a high concentration of minority carriers near the pn junction.

At the moment in which we change the direction of the voltage the direction of the generated current is also reversed, normally this reverse current would correspond to the saturation current, however due to ** Excess of minorities ** near the junction (produced during forward bias) the reverse current is proportional to the applied voltage and * external resistance *. With the passage of time the minority carriers cross the depletion region (decreasing the reverse current) but due to natural recombination and the increase in size of the induced field that drives them (increasing the reverse current) the reverse current remains constant. This period of time in which the zones near the depletion region are discharged depends on the capacitance of the diode and the lifetime of the carriers. Finally we reach equilibrium where the large field induced with the help of the applied voltage begins to decrease the reverse current, which before reaching the saturation current ends up emptying the last minority carriers that were close to the junction.

Two ways to decrease the recovery time or transient response is to decrease the applied current, so that the areas with excess minority generated would be less and therefore the discharge time would be less, the life time could also be reduced (Tao p and Tao n) of the minority which would also accelerate the discharge of the diode, this can be achieved for example by doping with slight amounts of gold. The switch-on time is usually shorter than the switch-off time because the rise time is minimal.

# Models for diode circuits

The first thing that stands out about diodes is that they have a ** Non-Linear ** relationship between their voltage and their current unlike resistors. In general, we have models for diodes depending on whether we apply a large signal (linear switch with cut-off voltage) or a small signal (logarithmic switch) to them. A first circuit with diodes would be a ** Voltage Rectifier **, the principle of the rectifier is that when the input voltage is greater than 0, the ideal diode lets the current pass and the output voltage will be equal to the input voltage, then when the voltage is less than 0 the diode does not allow the current to pass and therefore the output voltage is zero. In other words, it goes from a sinusoidal input signal with an average voltage of zero to a positive output signal with an average voltage greater than 0, this is the first step to convert an alternating current voltage to a direct current one.

## Iteration

There are several analysis methods where the primary objective is to obtain the voltage and current of the diode since there is no linear relationship between them. The first ones are the ** Iteration ** method (Trial and Error) and the ** Graphic ** method. Fundamental to both methods is Shockley's transcendental equation or the ** Diode Law ** that relates the voltage and current of an ideal diode (with its identity coefficient equal to 1):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	i\_D = I\_S \left( e^{(\frac{v\_D}{(v\_T)})} - 1 \right)
\end{gathered}
$$

1. This method is used when we know the reverse saturation current of the diode.
2. First analyze the circuit using LKC or LKV to obtain equations with the known values of the circuit.
3. The second step is to substitute the Diode Law in the equations obtained.
4. We are modifying the Voltage of the Diode until the values of the transcendental equation are equal.
5. In the previous step we can help ourselves with a calculator that clears the voltage of the diode.
6. With the Diode Voltage we solve the Diode Current from the equations of step 2.

For example, use the iteration method and a reverse saturation current of $ I_S = 10 ^ {13} A $ to obtain the diode current and voltage in the following circuit:

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/MetodoIteracion.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	LKV \implies V\_1 = ((I\_1)(R))+(V\_D) \land I\_1 = I\_D\\
	I\_D = (10^{-13})(e^{\frac{V\_D}{0.0258}})\\
	5 = \left((10^{-13})(e^{\frac{V\_D}{0.0258}})(2000)\right)+(V\_D)\\
	V\_D = 0.6158V \land I\_D = 0.0021989A
\end{gathered}
$$

## Graphical Method

If the circuit consists only of a voltage source and a limiting resistance then we can draw a ** Line of Load ** specific for these values with slope $ - \ frac {1} {R} $, the intersection between the line of load (linear) and the diode characteristics diagram (non-linear) is called ** Quiescent Point ** or Q point. For example for the above circuit:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	LKV \implies V\_1 = ((I\_1)(R))+(V\_D) \land I\_1 = I\_D\\
	V\_1 = ((I\_1)(R))+(V\_D) \implies I\_1 = \frac{V\_1-V\_D}{R}\\
	I\_1 = (10^{-13})(e^{\frac{V\_D}{0.0258}})\\
	0 = \frac{V\_1-V\_D}{R} \implies V\_1 = V\_D\\
	I\_1 = \frac{V\_1-0}{R} \implies I\_1 = \frac{V\_1}{R}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/MetodoGrafico.png)

## Lineal method by parts

We can facilitate even more the graphical method by load line if we substitute the exponential curve of characteristics of the diode by a linear approximation, this is called the linear model by parts. In this simplification, the characteristic curve before the cut-off voltage is assumed with zero current, without inverse saturation current ($ I_S = 0 $) and after the cut-off voltage, a straight line with slope is assumed $ \ frac {1} { r_f} $ where $ r_f $ is the ** Dynamic Resistance ** or internal resistance of the diode. We can still simplify the diode even more if we assume that the dynamic resistance is 0, that is, it is a vertical line. At this point we would be assuming that the diode is an ideal and completely linear component.

For example for the previous circuit if we know that the cut-off voltage is $ V_ \ gamma = 0.6 $ and the dynamic resistance is $ r_f = 10 \ Omega $ then we can calculate the diode current and its power dissipation linearly as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	LKC \implies I\_1 = I\_D = \frac{V\_1}{R} - \frac{V\_D}{R} = \frac{V\_1-V\_D}{R}\\
	V\_D = ((I\_D)(r\_f)) + V\_\gamma \implies I\_D = \frac{V\_1-(((I\_D)(r\_f)) + V\_\gamma)}{R}\\
	I\_D R = V\_1- I\_D r\_f - V\_\gamma \implies I\_D R + I\_D r\_f= V\_1 - V\_\gamma\\
	I\_D = \frac{V\_1-V\_\gamma}{R+r\_f} \implies I\_D = \frac{5-0.6}{2000+10} \approx 0.002189A\\
	V\_D = ((I\_D)(r\_f)) + V\_\gamma \implies V\_D = ((0.002189)(10))+(0.6) = 0.6218V\\
	P = VI = (0.002189)(0.6218) = 1.36mW
\end{gathered}
$$

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/MetodoPiezas.png)

The most important thing about this model is that the off diode behaves like an open circuit and when it is on it behaves like a voltage source ($ V_ \ gamma $) with a series resistance ($ r_f $). Although it is easier than using the Diode Law, it must also be remembered that the result will be less exact. Finally, a great advantage is that we can combine the graphical method by load line with the linear model by parts to quickly obtain all the values of the diode in different circuit configurations.

For example, if we assume that the cut-off voltage is $ V_ \ gamma = 0.7 $ and the dynamic resistance is $ r_f = 0 \ Omega $ then we can quickly obtain different configurations of the series circuit:

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/MetodoPiezas2.png)

## Model with alternating current

When a diode is used as a linear amplifier it is important to consider its alternating current characteristics. In the following circuit we can see how a ** small ** sinusoidal voltage signal ($ v_i $) is superimposed on a large constant voltage signal ($ V_ {PS} $). In this case we can obtain the output voltage of the circuit ($ V_O $) by means of a superposition analysis where the equivalent alternating current circuit replaces the diode with its * small signal incremental resistance * ($ r_d $) also called ** Diffusion Resistance **. To avoid confusion in the direct current analysis, it is specified that the voltage ($ V_ {DQ} $) and current ($ I_ {DQ} $) of the diode correspond to the Q point of the load line.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V\_D = V\_{DQ} + v\_d \implies I\_D = I\_S (e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}})\\
	I\_D = I\_S (e^{\frac{V\_{DQ}}{V\_T}})(e^{\frac{v\_d}{V\_T}})\\
	\text{Si el componente AC es muy pequeño entonces}\\
	e^{\frac{v\_d}{V\_T}} \approx 1+\frac{v\_d}{V\_T}\\
	I\_{DQ} = I\_S (e^{\frac{V\_{DQ}}{V\_T}})\\
	I\_D = (I\_{DQ})(1+\frac{v\_d}{V\_T}) = I\_{DQ} + \frac{I\_{DQ} v\_d}{V\_T}\\
	i\_d = \frac{I\_{DQ} v\_d}{V\_T} = (g\_d)(v\_d)\\
	v\_d = \frac{V\_T i\_d}{I\_{DQ}} = (r\_d)(i\_d)\\
	r\_d = \frac{1}{g\_d} = \frac{V\_T}{I\_{DQ}}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/CircuitoSenalAC.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{DC Analisis}\\\\
	v\_i = 0 \land V\_{DQ} = V\_\gamma = 0.6\\
	I\_{DQ} = \frac{V\_{PS} - V\_\gamma}{R} = \frac{5-0.6}{5000} = 0.00088A\\
	V\_O = (I\_{DQ})(R) = (0.00088)(5000) = 4.4V\\\\
	\text{AC Analisis}\\
	v\_i = (i\_d)(r\_d) + (i\_d)(R) = (i\_d)(r\_d+R) \land r\_d = \frac{1}{g\_d} = \frac{V\_T}{I\_{DQ}}\\
	r\_d = \frac{0.0258}{0.00088} = 29.39\Omega\\
	i\_d = \frac{v\_i}{r\_d+R} = \frac{0.1\sin(wt)}{29.39+5000} = 19.9 \sin(wt) \mu A\\
	v\_O = (i\_d)(R) = 19.9 \sin(wt) \mu A (5000) = 0.09941 \sin(wt) V 
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that in the previous problem we can simplify the Diode Law for the interval where the signals overlap since within this small interval the exponential function of the current behaves like a linear function.

Another important aspect in addition to the voltage difference in the diode is the frequency of the alternating current signal since if the frequency is too large the diode will remain in a constant state of charge and discharge of minority carriers which will increase the capacitance by diode diffusion. The diffusion capacitance generated by a high frequency can be much more significant than the PN junction capacitance. If we want to be more precise with our model of a superimposed alternating current circuit, we can take into account this diffusion capacitance and the junction capacitance when we substitute the diode in the equivalent circuit by means of the diffusion resistance. Finally a series resistor is added to represent the resistances of the neutral regions at the PN junction.

$$

	\text{Capacitancia por Difusion}\\
	C\_d = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta V\_D}\\
	\text{Ecuacion de Admitancia}\\
	Y = g\_d + jwC\_d

# Other types of diodes

A ** Solar Cell ** or photovoltaic cell is a pn junction with no applied voltage, the cell or diode is simply connected to a resistance that limits the current. When sunlight hits the depletion region, the generation of electrons and protons increases, this current by additional generation is called ** Photocurrent **. The photocurrent generates a voltage across the external resistor acting as a power source. Solar cells have a large surface area and are optimized to work in forward polarization to deliver the most power to the charge for each incidental photon.

Solar cells have been used particularly in space equipment and satellites, on earth they are not very convenient since the energy they generate is fixed and can only vary if it is stored in large batteries. A ** Photodiode ** is a type of photodetector similar to a solar cell, however in this case the diode is optimized with a package that detects a spectrum of visible light, increasing the amount of incidental photons in this spectrum also increases the reverse photocurrent in a linear fashion. The photodiodes are small to minimize junction capacitance and are optimized to work in reverse bias to generate the most carriers for each incidental photon.

** LEDs ** or light-emitting diodes are devices that convert current from an applied voltage into light. First let's understand that photons are normally generated when an electron passes from a higher energy band to a lower energy one, in semiconductors this happens when an electron recombines with a hole. There are materials with direct energy bands (AlGaAs) where the bands have the same amount of momentum, so the momentum of the electron is conserved when it passes from one band to another, allowing it to release the energy that had previously excited it in the form of a photon. . In materials with indirect energy bands (Si), the bands have different moments, so when passing from one band to another, the electron uses the energy that had excited it to change its moment, preventing the emission of a photon. In addition to being built with a material that emits photons of a certain frequency, LEDs are also optimized so as not to absorb the photons once generated (placing the P region near the surface). The current of the LED will be proportional to the recombination rate and therefore to the intensity of the light generated. LEDs are used in displays, or in an optical cavity to produce coherent photons with a short bandwidth (diode laser).

In conjunction with a photodiode, LEDs can be used to create optical transmission systems in telecommunications. The system enters a signal in the transmitter, the circuit sends the encoded signal to the LED, the LED sends the photons to the optical fiber, the photons reach the receiver with a photodiode which generates a current that is amplified by a circuit and finally generates the exit sign.

The ** Schottky Barrier Diode ** is made up of a conductive metal such as aluminum that comes into contact with an N-type semiconductor, forming an SB Rectifier Union. The characteristics are very similar to the PN junction since they use the same diode law with two important differences: The current in a pn junction is by diffusion or recombination of minority carriers while the current in the schottky diode comes from the flow of majority carriers. on the depletion region. This implies that the discharge time or transition from forward to reverse polarization is very short since there is practically no excess of minorities near the junction. Another difference is that the reverse current due to saturation is greater than that of a pn junction of similar area, this implies that the forward voltage necessary to generate the same current is lower. This short response time and low cut-off voltage make it very useful in integrated circuits. In extreme cases of doping, the Schottky diode becomes an ** Ohmic Contact ** where the properties of the diode disappear and the VI relationship is practically linear, ohmic contacts are used in integrated circuits to connect other diodes together.

The ** Zener ** diode is a diode designed to work on the reverse current that arises from applying a large enough specific reverse voltage. The reverse current generated by the Zener diode is much higher than that generated by a PN junction diode, which is why in Zener diodes it is even more important that there is a load that limits the current. In the Zener diode, the incremental resistance usually never exceeds tens of Ohms and is generally considered zero, this allows the Zener diode to be used in a circuit with variable current and resistance while maintaining a constant voltage.

# Diode thermometer

The exercise is to design a thermometer with the temperature characteristics of a diode. The temperature range should be 0 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. We use a silicon PN junction diode with reverse saturation current of I_S = 10 -13 A $ at T = 300K. We take advantage of the property of a diode where if its current is kept constant, the variation in its voltage can only come from a change in temperature. Ignoring the negative term we obtain the equation for the diode current as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	I\_D = I\_S (e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}}) = (n\_i^2)(e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}}) = (e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT}})(e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}})\\
	(e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT}})(e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}}) = (e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT}})(e^{\frac{eV\_D}{kT}})\\
	\frac{I\_{D1}}{I\_{D2}} = \frac{(e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_1}})(e^{\frac{eV\_{D1}}{kT\_1}})}{(e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_2}})(e^{\frac{eV\_{D2}}{kT\_2}})}\\
	\text{Con corriente constante:}\\
	(e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_1}})(e^{\frac{eV\_{D1}}{kT\_1}}) = (e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_2}})(e^{\frac{eV\_{D2}}{kT\_2}})\\
	(e^{\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_1}})(e^{\frac{eV\_{D1}}{kT\_1}})(e^{\frac{+E\_g}{kT\_2}}) = (e^{\frac{eV\_{D2}}{kT\_2}})
	\frac{-E\_g}{kT\_1} + \frac{eV\_{D1}}{kT\_1} + \frac{+E\_g}{kT\_2} = \frac{eV\_{D2}}{kT\_2}\\
	\frac{-E\_g k T\_2}{ekT\_1} + \frac{eV\_{D1} k T\_2}{ekT\_1} + \frac{+E\_g kT\_2}{ekT\_2} = V\_{D2}\\
	\frac{-E\_g}{e} (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1}) + V\_{D1} (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1}) + \frac{+E\_g}{e} = V\_{D2}\\
	\text{Asumiendo Eg/e constante:}\\
	-1.12 (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1}) + 1.12 +  V\_{D1} (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1}) = V\_{D2}\\
	1.12 (1- (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1})) + V\_{D1} (\frac{T\_2}{T\_1}) = V\_{D2}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Now let's consider the circuit using an arbitrary 15V voltage source and a 15k Ohm resistor. Analyzing this circuit we obtain the diode voltage at 300K by completing the general relationship between voltage and temperature.

![Problema](/static/images/electronica/Termometro.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	I\_D = \frac{V\_{PS} - V\_D}{R} = I\_S (e^{\frac{V\_D}{V\_T}})\\
	\frac{15 - V\_D}{15000} = 10^{-13} (e^{\frac{V\_D}{0.0258}})\\
	V\_D \approx 0.53505V\\
	\therefore V = 1.12 - 0.535 (\frac{T}{300})

In real life this circuit would need two more components to function, first a circuit that can measure the diode voltage without generating an additional load (for example an Op Amp circuit) and also a circuit that converts the voltage into its corresponding digital value of temperature.
