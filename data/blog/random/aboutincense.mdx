Incense is an aromatic material that when burned releases a fragrant smoke. The term comes from the Latin *incendere* meaning *to burn*. It is composed of vegetal resins often combined with essential oils. Throughout the world it has been commonly associated with religion and healing. In Mexico and Central America cultures like the Purepecha, Maya and Mexica used a version of incense from the *Protium copal* tree called *copal*, the word comes from the Nahuatl *copalli* meaning *resin*. 

Incense can be subdivided into direct or indirect burning. Indirect incense needs to be burn on top of coal or a hot metal plate, direct burning is combustible by itself and can be lit directly. You can find incense in the shape of a spiral for longer burning time, in a cone for a quick burning time, around hollowed sticks of bamboo from India and China and lastly in solid sticks from Japan.

In hebrew it was called *levonah*, in greek *libanos*, in arabic *luban*, romans used to call it *olibanum*, all of this words meant *milk* since that was the aspect of the resin recently extracted from the tree to make incense. In occident the most popular incense was from *olibano* or *mirra*. Incense has been a valuable commodity throughout history, it was used since Egyptian civilizations with inscriptions showing the use of incense in mummifications and religious rituals.

Different cultures have used incense in slightly different ways though the centuries. Arabian incense is burned in chips or blocks called *bakhoor* inside a *mabkhara*. Chinese incense is made with agarwood or sandalwood, and grew in popularity with the introduction of Buddhism. Indian incense sticks are known as *agarbatti*, today India is the primary user and producer of incense. Japanese incense may accompany traditional ceremonies using agarwood or sandalwood. The sandalwood incense that comes from Mysore in Karnataka, India is highly valued.

There are studies that link prolongued breathing of incense in high concentrations to increase the risk of certain types of respiratory cancer. This is because incense smoke contains various contaminants including Benzo(a)pyrene, CO, NOx, SOx, VOCs, PAHs and toxic metals. Indian Sandalwood has the highest concentration of contaminants, followed by Japanese Aloeswood, Taiwanese Aloeswood and Chinese Sandalwood.
