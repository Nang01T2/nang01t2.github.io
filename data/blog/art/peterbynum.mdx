* American painter, creator of the exhibition "Illuminated Paint" composed of sculptural paintings inside glass plates. 
* Inside the plates there are intricate natural patterns found in tree branches or the nervous system. 
* He studied film and photography at New York Film University and now creates modern three-dimensional plastic works.

> I find his sculptural paintings a unique medium, they are independent of human planning similar to abstract expressionism, the beauty of its synaptic connections its undoubtable and it is accentuated by the imposition monolithic and translucent presence of the plate, allowing to view it from multiple angles.
