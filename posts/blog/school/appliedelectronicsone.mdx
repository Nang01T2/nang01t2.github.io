# Operational Amplifier #

**Definition**

![Simple Op-Amp](/static/images/notes/LM741AppliedElectro.png)

Op-Amps are high gain, direct current, coupled electronic amplifiers with two inputs and one output, in other words they are voltage dependent voltage sources. The first monolithic op-amp was created in 1964 at the Fairchild Semiconductor Company by Robert John Widlar (μA702). Despite living in a digital world they are still widely used in engineering when working with analog signals.

Op-Amps are bipolar in nature since they can be supplied with a negative (VEE Emitter or VDD Drain) or positive (VCC Collector or VSS Source) voltage source. The working voltage sources produce negative (Ic-) and positive (Ic+) currents. Note that VEE and VCC apply to BJT transistor based Op-Amps while VCC and VSS apply to FET transistor based Op-Amps.

Aside from its voltage sources the Op-Amp uses a Non Inverting (Vp) and Inverting (Vn) input signals to determine its output voltage (Vo). The range of voltages that an Op-Amp can output is determined by its sources. Kirchhoff's Current Law shows that every current that enters and exits the Op-Amp must equal cero: $i_n + i_p + i_{c+} + i_{c-} + i_o = 0$

**Real Open Loop Gain**

![Detailed Op-Amp](/static/images/notes/DetailedOpAmpAppliedElectro.png)

As mentioned before the voltage differential $V_i = V_p - V_n$ is used to determine the output voltage $V_o$ of the voltage dependent voltage source. The factor by which this voltage differential relates to the output is called open loop gain $A$. The open loop gain of an LM741 Op-Amp is around $200000 \frac{V_o}{V_i}$. 

The *Op-Amp Curve* represents the range in which the relation between input and output voltages. Outside of the linear range the input will have little effect over the output, meaning that the output will remain constant (saturation).

**Ideal Open Loop Gain**

| Value | Ideal Model | Real Op-Amp |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Input Impedance $R_i$ | Infinite (No current from signals) | $10^6 \land 10^12$ Ohms |
| Output Impedance $R_o$ | 0 (No voltage loss at output) | $>100$ Ohms | 
| Open Loop Gain $A$ | Infinite (Perfectly Linear) | $\approx 200000$ (Depends on signal bandwidth) |
| Offset | 0 | mV to nV (Output offset when inputs are grounded) |
| Bias Currents $i_p$ and $i_n$ | 0 | uA to nA (Current from signals) |
| Bias Voltage (Supply) | Any Value | Generally $\pm 18 V$ |

A hook ammeter is used to measure current without opening the circuit, another way of measuring current is by using a shunt resistor.

**Ideal Closed Loop Gain**

![Negative Feedback](/static/images/notes/ExampleIdealInvertingOpAmpAppliedElectro.png)

An Op Amp can be used as a simple control system when a fraction of the output is used as feedback by substracting it from the inverter input signal. By using an Op-Amp in this way we are creating a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control system. Note that the feedback generates an additional gain in the system called the closed loop gain (G).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Real Closed Loop Gain}\\
	G = \frac{V_o}{V_i} = \frac{A}{1+\beta A} \implies V_o = (V_i)(G)\\
	\text{Ideal Closed Loop Gain}\\\\
	A = \infty \implies G = \frac{1}{\beta}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Superposition Analysis**

![Inverting Circuit](/static/images/notes/SolvingBySuperpositionInvertingOpAppliedElectro.png)

The following is the negative feedback configuration for an *Op-Amp inverter* assuming ideal conditions but with a finite value for $A$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Superposition}\\
	Vn_{o} = \frac{(V_o)(R_2)}{R_1 + R_2} \land Vn_i = \frac{(V_i)(R_2)}{R_1 + R_2}\\
	V_n = V_o + (R_2)\left(\frac{V_i}{R_1+R_2} - \frac{V_o}{R_1+R_2} \right) = V_o + \left( \frac{(R_2)(V_i-V_o)}{R_1+R_2} \right)\\
	V_n = \frac{V_o(R_1) + V_o(R_2) + V_i(R_2) - V_o(R_2)}{R_1+R_2} = \frac{(V_o R_1) + (V_i R_2)}{R_1+R_2}\\
	V_o = V_i(G) = (V_p-V_n)(G) \land V_p = 0\\
	V_o = -(V_n)(G) \implies V_n = \frac{(-(V_n)(G)(R_1)) + (V_i R_2)}{R_1+R_2}\\
	V_n = (V_i)\frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1(G+1)} \implies V_o = -\left((V_i)\frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1(G+1)}\right)(G)\\
	\frac{V_o}{V_i} = \frac{-(G)(R_2)}{R_2+R_1(G+1)} = \frac{-R_2}{\frac{R_2}{G} + \frac{(R_1)(G)+ R_1}{G}} = \frac{-R_2}{\frac{(R_2 + R_1)}{G} + R_1}\\
	A = \infty \implies \frac{V_o}{V_i} = \frac{-R_2}{R_1}\\
	\therefore V_o = (V_i)\frac{-R_2}{R_1}\\\\
	\text{Voltage Divider}\\
	V_n = 0 = (V_o - V_i)\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} + V_i\\
	(V_o)\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} = (V_i)\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} - (V_i)\\
	(V_o)\frac{(R_1)(R_1+R_2)}{(R_1+R_2)(R_1)} = (V_i)\frac{(R_1)(R_1+R_2)}{(R_1+R_2)(R_1)} - (V_o)\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1}\\
	V_o = (V_i - V_i)\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1} = (V_i)\left(1+\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1}\right)\\
	V_o = (V_i)\left(\frac{R_1 - R_1 - R_2}{R_1}\right) = (V_i)\frac{-R_2}{R_1}\\
	\therefore V_o = (V_i)\frac{-R_2}{R_1} = V_i(G)
\end{gathered}
$$

Applying the same analysis for an ideal *Op-Amp Non Inverter* we have:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Voltage Divider}\\
	V_n = (V_o - V_i)\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} = V_i\\
	(V_o)\left(\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}\right)\left(\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1}\right) = (V_i)\frac{R_1+R_2}{R_1}\\
	\therefore V_o = (V_i)\left(1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}\right) = V_i(G)\\
\end{gathered}
$$

**Virtual Ground Analysis**

![Inverting and Non Inverting](/static/images/notes/InvertingandNonInvertingAppliedElectro.png)

Virtual ground is a technique used to simplify Op Amp analysis by assuming that $V_n = V_p$, usually meaning that it has no voltage. This is a valid generalization even if there is no galvanic connection to ground. Virtual ground is not valid when the open loop gain is smaller than the closed loop gain.

Generally the open loop gain will be greater than the closed loop gain since few applications require the use of resistors with such a difference between their values. Another thing to consider is the use of high resistances in real life Op-Amps to mitigate the input currents as much as possible.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Virtual Ground}\\
	I_{R1} =  I_{R2} = I_{o}\\
	I_{R1} = \frac{V_{in}  - V_n}{R_1} \land I_{R2} = \frac{V_n  - V_o}{R_2}\\
	\frac{V_{in}  - V_n}{R_1} = \frac{V_n  - V_o}{R_2}\\
	V_n = 0 \implies \frac{V_{in}}{R_1} = \frac{-V_o}{R_2}\\
	\therefore V_o = -\frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{R_1} = V_{in} (G)
\end{gathered}
$$


**Op Amps in Series**

In a control system you can have a SISO (Single Input Single Output) or MIMO (Multiple Input Single Output) configuration. By connecting two Op-Amps in series (SISO) their combined transfer function will be the product of their internal relations. Notice that in the case of two inverters the negative sign is lost meaning that they become a non-inverting unit.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_{o1} = -\frac{(V_{in1})(R_2)}{R_1} \land V_{o2} = -\frac{(V_{in2})(R_4)}{R_3}\\
	V_o = \left(\frac{(-R_4)(-R_2)}{(R_3)(R_1)}\right)(V_{in})
\end{gathered}
$$

**Summing and Differential Op Amps**

![Summing and Differential](/static/images/notes/SummingandDiferentialAppliedElectro.png)

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Differential}\\
	I_1 = \frac{V_1-V_a}{R_1} \land I_2 = \frac{V_2-V_b}{R_2} \land I_3 = \frac{V_a-V_o}{R_3}\\
	V_a = V_b = (V_2)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_2+R_4}\right)\\
	V_2 = 0 \implies V_{oa} = (V_1)\left(\frac{-R_3}{R_1}\right)\\
	V_1 = 0 \implies V_{ob} = (V_2)\left(\frac{R_1+R_3}{R_1}\right)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_2+R_4}\right)\\
	V_o = V_{ob} - V_{oa}\\
	R_1 = R_2 \land R_3 = R_4 \implies V_o = \frac{(R_3)(V_2 - V_1)}{R_1}\\
	R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R_4 \implies V_o = (V_2 - V_1)
\end{gathered}

**Exercise 1 (Instrumentation Amplifier)**

![Exercise 1](/static/images/notes/ExerciseOneFeedbackOpAppliedElectro.png)

Calculate an expression for $V_{o}$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_{o2} = \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)(V_2) + \left(\frac{-R_2}{R_1}\right)(V_1)\\
	V_{o1} = \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)(V_1) + \left(\frac{-R_2}{R_1}\right)(V_2)\\
	V_{o} = V_{1} - V_{2} \land a = \frac{R_2}{R_1} \land b = V_1 \land c = V_2\\
	V_{o} = (1 + a)(b) - (a)(c) - (1 + a)(c) + (a)(b)\\
	V_{o} = (1 + a)(b - c) + (a)(b - c) \implies V_{o} = (1 + 2a)(b - c)\\
	V_{o} = \left(1 + \left(\frac{(2)(R_2}{R_1}\right)\right)(V_1 - V_2)\\
	\therefore V_{o} = \left(1 + \left(\frac{(2)(5000)}{R_{500}}\right)\right)(V_1 - V_2)\\
\end{gathered}
$$


**Exercise 2 (Non inverter)**

![Exercise 2](/static/images/notes/ExerciseTwoFeedbackOpAppliedElectro.png)

Calculate $V_{o}$ with the initial data.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_i = 80\mu\text{V} \land R_f = 470\,\text{k}\Omega \land R_1 = 4.3\,\text{k}\Omega\\
	R_2 = 33\,\text{k}\Omega \land R_3 = 33\,\text{k}\Omega\\\\
	V_{o1} = 1 + \frac{470000}{4300}(80) = (110.3)(80) = 8.824\,\text{mV}\\
	V_{o2} = -\frac{(0.008824)(470000)}{(33000)} = −125.678\,\text{mV}\\
	V_{o3} = -\frac{(-0.12568)(470000)}{(33000)} = 1.7899\,\text{V}\\
	\therefore V_o \approx 1.79\,\text{V}
\end{gathered}
$$


**Exercise 3**

![Exercise 3](/static/images/notes/ExerciseThreeFeedbackOpAppliedElectro.png)

Calculate $V_{sal}$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Equivalent Sources}\\
	V_i = (0.001)(150) = 0.15\,\text{V}\\
	V_{sal} = -\frac{(0.15)(2200)}{(150)} = -2.2\,\text{V}\\
	\therefore V_{sal} = -2.2\,\text{V}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 4**

![Exercise 4](/static/images/notes/ExerciseFourFeedbackOpAppliedElectro.png)

Find an expression relating $V_{in}$ with $V_{o}$. Calculate $V_o$ when $t=3$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_o = -\frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{R_1}\\
	V_{in} = 2 + 2\sin(3(t)) \, \text{mV}\\
	V_o = -\frac{(2 + 2\sin(3(t)) \, \text{mV})(2\,\text{k}\,\Omega)}{1\,\text{k}\,\Omega}\\
	\therefore V_o = -4-4\sin(3(t)) \, \text{mV}\\
	\therefore V_o (t=3) = -4.0016\,\text{V}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 5 (Summing Inverter)**

![Exercise 5](/static/images/notes/ExerciseFiveFeedbackOpAppliedElectro.png)

Calculate $V_{sal}$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_{i1} = -\frac{(1)(10)}{2} = -5\,\text{V}\\
	V_{i2} = -\frac{(2)(10)}{2} = -10\,\text{V}\\
	V_{i3} = -\frac{(3)(10)}{2} = -15\,\text{V}\\
	\text{Equivalent Sources}\\
	I_{i1} = -0.05\,\text{A} \land I_{i2} = -0.1\,\text{A} \land I_{i3} = -0.15\,\text{A}\\
	I_i = -0.3\,\text{A}\\
	R_1 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{100}} = 33.33 \, \Omega\\
	V_i = (-0.3)(33.33) = -10\,\text{V}\\	
	V_{sal} = -\frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{R_1} \implies V_{sal} = -\frac{(-10))(R_2)}{33.33}\\
	\therefore V_{sal} = (0.3)(R)
\end{gathered}
$$

**Scale Changer**

![Scale Changer](/static/images/notes/ScaleChangerForAppliedElectro.png)

When working in signal conditioning from a sensor to a DAQ you can use Op-Amps to change the voltage scale to the one you need. We can use their linear relation to find the resistances needed in a scale changer circuit. Note that if we don't have a particular resistor value we can trim its carbon to get the desired value.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	y = \mu (x) + b = 1.0416(x) + 2.5\\
	V_o = -\frac{R_5}{R_4} \left(-\frac{R_3}{R_1}(V_1)-\frac{R_3}{R_2}(V_2)\right)\\
	\mu = 1.0416 = \frac{R_3}{R_1}\\
	R_4 = R_5 = 47\, \text{k \Omega}\\
	R_1 = 10 \, \text{k \Omega}\\
	\therefore R_2 = R_3 = 10.416\, \text{k \Omega}
\end{gathered}
$$
