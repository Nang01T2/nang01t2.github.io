* German photographer who worked 8 years for stern magazine before retiring to capture the architecture of mega cities. 
* Michael opened his studio in Hong Kong hoping to continue capturing the intimidating mega cities and the anonymity they can provide.
* Man is reduced to a product, processed and stored in small departments, within an endless pattern and a skyless landscape. 
* Curiously, as a city dweller, you identity with the multitude of strangers and how they live in their urban environment.

> Beyond the imposing beauty of his compositions, Michael's studies on the concrete skin of cities make us reflect on the thousands of people who live in the background of each photo. In this way he establishes himself, not only as a photographer of urban structures, but in the many ways that people adapt to this changing environment, providing us with a fascinating and complex portrait of human life in the city.
