## English Metal Group (Heavy Metal - 1975) ##

* Steve Harris (Composer, bassist, vocals and keyboard).
* Founded in 1975 by Steve Harris when he was 19 years old, debuting at Stratford. 
* The name of the band comes from the movie *The Man in the Iron Mask*. 
* The band had a Boing 747 private jumbo titled *Ed Force One*.
* The band mascot is Eddie, originally a papier-mâché background mask from their early concerts. 
* They got inspiration from Metallica, Avenged Sevenfold, Antrax, Slipknot and Slayer.
* Steve in turn has stated that his inspirations were: 
	* Wishbone, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, UFO and Ash.
* Wrongly considered satanic for the release of the album *The Number of the Beast*. 
	* Steve got the idea for the album title of a nightmare triggered after watching the movie *Damien:Omen 2* and after reading the poem *Tam o' Shanter*.
