<div class="caption"> Moby Dick - Gouache and Ink (1943) </div>
<p>Based on the sixth book by Herman Melville, it has been questioned if Pollock actually read the novel however both authors touch on the themes of paranoia and a preoccupation with tragic violence.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/GuardiansOfTheSecret.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Guardians of the Secret - Oil (1943) </div>
<p>Representation of the feeling in Indian rituals that Pollock witnessed as a child, some believe that he tried to adopt the spiritual significance of Native American ritual painting when developing his Drip Painting style.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/MaleAndFemale.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Male and Female - Oil (1943) </div>

<p><img src="/static/images/art/ThereWereSeveninEight.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> There Were Seven in Eight - Oil and Enamel (1945) </div>
<p>This several month painting uses the figurative imagery of heads, eyes, bodies, snakes and fantastic creatures under a network of black lines that prevent any focal point from emerging, marking his transition into nonrepresentational works.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/ShimmeringSubstance.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Shimmering Substance - Oil (1946) </div>
<p>One of his first completely nonrepresentational works, he squeezed the paint directly into the canvas and manipulated it with a palette knife or his fingers to create open loops. There is an allusion to light and nature, possibly a sunny summer day.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/EyesInTheHeat.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Eyes in the Heat - Oil and Enamel (1946) </div>
<p>The light, flora and fauna of Long Island are evoked in the painting, this painting shows a thick and textured crust, it&#x27;s possible to identify the eyes of some creatures concealed by the paint.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/FullFathomFive.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Full Fathom Five - Oil (1947) </div>
<p>One of the first drip paintings, it has particularly strange layer of oil paint combined with nails, buttons, keys, coins, cigarettes, matches and other items. The title was suggested by a neighbor from a line from Shakespeare&#x27;s play <em>The Tempest</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reviewer a while back wrote that my pictures didn&#x27;t have any beginning or any end. He didn&#x27;t mean it as a compliment, but it was. It was a fine compliment. Only he didn&#x27;t know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/War.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> War - Ink and Pencil (1947) </div>
<p>His only drawing ever titled, created in 1947 but related to his earlier works. A fierce depiction of the destruction caused by WWII, represented by a tortured human body, a bull and various human parts.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Lucifer.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Lucifer - Oil and Enamel (1947) </div>
<p>Modern painting that started his use of black enamel and aluminum paints, traditionally reserved for industrial uses. The green was added by putting the canvas on its side for a final set of horizontal drips. Pollock gave the painting to Grant Mark, a chemist that tried to help him with his alcoholism, the title refers both to the morning star and to the fallen angel.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Number17A.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> No. 17A - Oil on Fiberboard (1948) </div>
<p>Owned by Hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, purchased in 2015 for $200 million, a then record breaking price. The piece was featured on the 1949 edition of Life that made Pollock a celebrity.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Arabesque.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Arabesque No. 13A - Oil and Enamel (1948) </div>
<p>Pollock is said to have liked it enough that this was the painting he choose to display at his living room.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Summertime.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Summertime No. 9A - Oil and Enamel (1948) </div>

<p><img src="/static/images/art/NumberTen.png" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> No. 10 - Oil (1949) </div>
<p>Unlike other drip paintings this one includes random trails of black enamel signaling his emotional struggle with alcoholism.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Number30.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> No. 30 - Enamel (1950) </div>
<p>Also known as Autumn Rhythm, its size envelopes the viewer, a display of subconscious creativity and choreography.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/OneNumber31.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> One No. 31 - Oil (1950) </div>
<p>Masterpiece of Jackson Pollock, one of the largest and most iconic drip style paintings, the other two being No. 30 and Blue Poles, this painting represents an endless rhythm and energy. Art scholars have praised a sense of order amidst the chaos of this painting. It has also been used to prove that Pollock&#x27;s works contain non-random fractal geometry patterns.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/MuralonIndianRedGround.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Mural on Indian Red Ground - Oil (1950) </div>
<p>Acquired by the queen Farah Pahlavi, an avid Iranian collector who established the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1977, however the painting was exhibited for the first time in 2005 long after the 1979 revolution.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/LavenderMist.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Lavender Mist No. 1 - Oil and Enamel (1950) </div>
<p>A vast and alive expanse of colored scribbles that the eye naturally follows, that marks the end of the color drip painting era for Pollock.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Number32.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> No. 32 - Oil (1950) </div>
<p>Pollock stops using color, to spread the paint over such a large canvas Pollock had to run across it creating very expressive lines and shapes</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/ElegantLady.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Elegant Lady No. 5 - Enamel (1951) </div>
<p>Part of a series of black enamel paintings executed in 1951, he experimented with syringes to apply the enamel, there is also a partial return to figuration.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Echo.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> In Echo No. 25 - Enamel (1951) </div>
<p>Another black enamel painting from the same period as No. 5, it has some figuration elements while remaining abstract.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/Convergence.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Convergence - Oil (1952) </div>
<p>This painting is an outsider, an unexpected but brief return to his color drip painting method. It was well received in the cold war representing American freedom of speech, it was even promoted by the CIA since it stayed away from communist social realism and political gestures.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/OceanGreyness.jpg" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> Ocean Greyness - Oil (1953) </div>
<p>Several disembodied eyes can be seen hidden within the swirling colored fragments, Pollock tries to reintroduce the quasi-figurative elements from the start of his career.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/art/TheDeep.png" alt="Painting"/></p>
<div class="caption"> The Deep - Oil and Enamel (1953) </div>
<p>An extreme simplification of color and content, its symbolism and title have prompted considerable debate over the years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Painting is a state of being. Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.</p>
