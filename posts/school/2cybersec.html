defending computers and electronic systems from malicious attacks, also known as information technology security or electronic information security.</li><li>The most common attack for password access is social engineering.</li></ul><h2 id="types-of-cybersecurity"><a href="#types-of-cybersecurity" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px]

Prevent data and code used by a business from being stolen or hijacked with penetration testing and encryption.</li><li>Information: Prevent physical and digital data from unathorized access and manipulation, on site and remote systems.</li><li>Infrastructure: Make sure that structures and facilities such as the electrical grid, data centers are access controlled</li><li>Network security: Secure internal computer networks agains unauthorized access with tools like remote access management and 2FA</li><li>Users Education: Teach every employee and customer for recognizing and avoiding malware and phishing.</li></ul><p>Cybersecurity is important since it protects data from theft and damage, including sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), health information (PHI), intellectual property and govermental and industry systems. Attackers are no longer enthusiast but fully organized crime groups. In 2021 3.5 million positions go unfulfilled globally.</p><p>The average cost of remediating a ransomware have gone to 1.85 million (2021) from downtime, lost orders, operational costs, the ransom on crytocoins average only costs a tenth of the losses. The number of organizations that paid the ransom is also increasing to 32 percent (2021) even if less than 10 percent of the ones that pay recover all of their data. The Mexican Law of Cybersecurity is included in 211 of Codigo Penal Federal, the nation has a national guard cybercrime unit, federal law dictates personal data protection and the official cost of cyberattacks is valued at 7.7 billion dollars (2017). Sadly Mexico is the greatest producer of cp.</p><p>Assets are something of value to a person, business or organization. IT assets are any element used in to add value to the organization such as software (DBMS, Office, OS, Apps), hardware (Servers, routers, switches, IoT, Appliances, HVAC, PSU), data (Domains, customers, personnel, finances, code, industrial secrets) or other (public image, credibility).</p><ul><li>Threats: Something that could cause harm to a system or organization.</li><li>Vulnerability: Flaw or weakness that can be used to attack.</li><li>Exploit: Attack on a computer system that takes advantage of a particular vulnerability in the operating system, application or any software code.</li></ul><p>Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) are the pillars of modern cybersecurity and good security systems. This must be taken into account on Process level (management systems, governance, policies, 3rd party management), Data level (IT, OT, Personal Data, Operational Data) and on a People level (Training, awareness, skills, qualifications, authorization and physical security).</p><ul><li>Confidentiality: Component associated with secrecy and the use of encryption, data must be available only to authorized agents. If information is confidential then it hasn&#x27;t been compromised by other parties, data can&#x27;t be disclosed to people who do not require them or should not have access to them. Information is organized in a way that only the person that needs the information can have access. Breaches are commonly through hacking or social engineering. Hashes are the most common way of encryption (one way functions).</li><li>Integrity: Data integrity refers to the certainty that data won&#x27;t be tampered or degraded during or after submission. Data must be keept secure from unauthorized modification even if unintentional. Data could be compromised mainly during upload or transmission or during storage in a database.</li><li>Availability: Information is available to authorized users, done by having properly functioning systems, security controls and communication channels. Critical systems (power generation, medical equipment, safety devices) often have extreme availability requirements (cyber threats, power outagaes, hardware failures and other events).</li></ul><p>Cybersecurity Attributes</p><ul><li>Authenticity: Property of data or system of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted in transmission, data and storage.</li><li>Nonrepudiation: Property of data or system of assurance that another agent can&#x27;t deny you authenticity, nonrepudiation is the ability to ensure that communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or message.</li><li>Privacy: Property of data or system that assured that an individual can control or influence data related to them from being collected and stored by others.</li></ul><p>Cybersecurity is the prevention of damage to, protecion of and restoration of computers, electronic systems and information contained therein to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication and nonrepudiation. It is a subset of information technology security using CIA for asset protection of cyber and physical systems. Today both terms are used interchangeably.</p><hr/><h1 id="threat"><a href="#threat" class="anchor no-underline flex items-center before:-translate-x-[8px] before:-ml-[20px] before:bg-no-repeat before:bg-contain before:w-[20px] before:h-[20px] before:content-[&#x27;&#x27;] hover:before:bg-[url(&#x27;/link.svg&#x27;)]">Threat</a></h1><p>Cyber threat intelligence is information about threats and threat actors that mitigate harmful events, sources include open source, social media, humans, technical and deep web.</p><ul><li>Threat: Active entity that can cause damage to a person or organization, also called adversarial as they oppose the business objectives.
