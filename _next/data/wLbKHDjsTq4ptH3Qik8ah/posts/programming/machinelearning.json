I completed full interview loops at 13 companies and received 11 offers. I'm glad I got the rejections I did - it was clear there wasn't a mutual match. In the future, I likely won't apply as much. Depending on your needs you might have to apply to a similar amount of companies but I don't recommend going through interview loops at this many companies unless you're actively exploring.

Sell yourself: Highlight the projects you're most proud of. Focus on the highest scope projects (largest impact, most engineers/users affected, etc). I generally hate bragging but if there is one time to brag, it's during an interview. Applying Applying itself is thankfully fairly standardized in a lot of places. You'll apply online, submitting your resume and filling out some standard fields - or you'll ask for a referral, where someone puts in a (hopefully good) word for you, and then you get a link to the form. Then a recruiter will set up a call to ask more about you, determine if there's a mutual fit, and then schedule a screening interview.

Take it seriously. When I started, I'd just do the question leisurely and try to learn, look things up, etc. That didn't help much when it came to a real interview setting. So, try to time yourself, and approach it like you would a real interview, including testing. For the interview itself: think out loud (the interviewer can't read your mind), talk through what you are thinking, and get buy-in on the approach before coding. Watch for hints! And, lastly, remember to test your code thoroughly - look at what you wrote, not what you think you wrote. System design interviews These seem quite intimidating, especially if you've never done them before (I never had!). The way they are structured is both a plus and a minus.

Make sure you understand who's using the system, what the requirements are, etc. Don't jump into solving things upfront. Behavioral interview prep Depending on where you interview, this might be called a behavioral interview, a culture fit interview, a career interview, etc. Naming aside, they have one thing in common: you'll be expected to talk about your past experiences in some depth, with the interviewer leading the discussion.

The interviewer will have a lot of material to cover, so just answer the question to the point, don't add too much extra detail, and offer to elaborate if needed. If you elaborate too much on every answer, you won't be able to convey your best impression. Focus on the STAR method. For each thing, explain the Situation, what the Task at hand was, what Action you took, and what the Result was. Make your role in whatever happened clear. Other interviews Depending on where you apply, there might be other types of interviews thrown in.

If the interviewer asks if you need a minute at the start, and you do - please take it. At a higher level, if you're interviewing across multiple companies, try to have a half day/day between sets of interviews. Don't stress out. Nerves can make or break an interview. Failing an interview is not a negative judgment of who you are - it's just a performance in a highly artificial setting. If you lower the stakes for yourself, you'll find yourself performing better. Feel free to ask for help or a hint if you're stuck. It's okay! I did that a bunch rather than waste time and have the interviewer write me off. Learn from yourself. I kept detailed notes of every question I was asked and the responses I gave so that I could debrief myself at the end of the day and do better the next day. This is easy to do when you're remote (and hard to do in person) so take advantage of it while you can! Ask for clear expectations at the start of the interview, if not provided - e.g. for a coding interview, ask about how much they expect you to cover, whether you need to write working code or pseudocode, etc. Fact finding & decision making Throughout the process, you're interviewing companies too, to find the right fit. Refer back to your criteria list to make sure you've gotten enough information for each company. I found it quite helpful to ask each interviewer a few questions from my list at the end of each interview to make sure I had everything covered.

A great recruiter makes a world of a difference as a candidate - there were a few that went above and beyond, helping me with extra prep calls, answering all of my questions, and being flexible whenever I needed a change. On the flip side, a bad recruiter can be very off-putting, especially when it comes to things like ignoring communication preferences or ghosting you (I had a particularly bad experience there). Relatedly, candidate experience matters a lot. A few companies sent doordash/ubereats gift cards instead of the lunch they'd normally provide in an in-person interview setting, and it helped save mental energy for the interviews Unique interview experiences stand out! There were a bunch, but the most memorable ones include: fly.io had an asynchronous process. The take-home was a great way to learn about the company culture, and I really loved that they delivered feedback and gave me a chance to improve my take-home before submitting it. Akita had an interesting 90-minute coding challenge where I had to work on a real-world problem and build a useful feature - beyond just coding, I got to learn about the domain and exercise problem-solving skills. Felt had a work-day exercise where (for an EM role) I got to have two 1:1s with members of the team (like I would on the job) and then debrief afterward with the interviewers to give suggestions. It was very refreshingly different and interesting. The interview setup and experience tell you a lot about the company and what they value. Pay attention to the questions they ask and the people you meet. As an example, interviewing at CZI was really positive for me: I got to see exactly how passionate everyone was about the mission and how they got people from all backgrounds to work there (it was the most diverse interview panel I had).

It's still a candidate's market for now, so use that to your advantage. Companies are looking to hire, and despite hiring freezes a lot of great companies are still growing. Core skills matter a lot - you have to be good at what you do. In the same vein, at the senior levels, it's less about pure technical depth (unless you're going for a very specialized position) and more about \\\"soft\\\" skills: how you lead a team, how you work with people, etc. This is good and bad: but helps for interviews as you can apply for a broad set of roles. In hindsight I wouldn't have applied to as many roles as I did - but hey, I wanted to explore. Interviewing for 6-7 hours 4-5 days/week for 3 weeks straight got a bit much, and my calendar was so full that rescheduling things became a nightmare. I had a couple of days with 6 interviews with 5 different companies and I do not recommend that experience. Don't overdo the leetcode: I felt like I prepared all the \\\"hard\\\" questions while I mostly got asked \\\"easy\\\" or \\\"medium\\\" ones. That would definitely have cut down on prep time. Learn about stock compensation/all the various forms of equity. I had to scramble to learn these while making my decision and in hindsight, I should have learnt about this stuff earlier. References: A surprising number of companies asked for references. I'd probably have prepared better for this rather than bother busy people at the last minute as I did.

BATES—THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX A few times in a generation, a product comes along that catapults a technology from the fluorescent gloom of engineering department basements, the fetid teenage bedrooms of nerds, and the lonely man caves of hobbyists—into something that your great-aunt Edna knows how to use. There were web browsers as early as 1990. But it wasn’t until Netscape Navigator came along in 1994 that most people discovered the internet. There were MP3 players before the iPod debuted in 2001, but they didn’t spark the digital music revolution. There were smartphones before Apple dropped the iPhone in 2007 too—but before the iPhone, there wasn’t an app for that. On Nov. 30, 2022, artificial intelligence had what might turn out to be its Netscape Navigator moment. The moment was ushered in by Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, a San Francisco–based A.I. company that was founded in 2015 with financial backing from a clutch of Silicon Valley heavy hitters—including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and fellow PayPal alum and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman. On Nov. 30, some seven years after the company’s launch, Altman tweeted: “today we launched ChatGPT. try talking with it here,” followed by a link that would let anyone sign up for an account to begin conversing with OpenAI’s new chatbot for free. And anyone—and everyone—has. And not just to chat about the weather. Amjad Masad, a software CEO and engineer, asked it to debug his code—and it did. Gina Homolka, a food blogger and influencer, got it to write a recipe for healthy chocolate-chip cookies. Riley Goodside, an engineer at Scale AI, asked it to write the script for a Seinfeld episode. Guy Parsons, a marketer who also runs an online gallery dedicated to A.I. art, got it to write prompts for him to feed into another A.I. system, Midjourney, that creates images from text descriptions. Roxana Daneshjou, a dermatologist at Stanford University School of Medicine who also researches A.I. applications in medicine, asked it medical questions. Lots of students used it to do their homework. And that was just in the first 24 hours following the chatbot’s release. There have been chatbots before. But not like this. ChatGPT can hold long, fluid dialogues, answer questions, and compose almost any kind of written material a person requests, including business plans, advertising campaigns, poems, jokes, computer code, and movie screenplays. It’s far from perfect: The results are not always accurate; it can’t cite the sources of its information; it has almost no knowledge of anything that happened after 2021. And what it delivers—while often smooth enough to pass muster in a high school class or even a college course—is rarely as polished as what a human expert could produce. On the other hand, ChatGPT produces this content in about a second—often with little to no specific knowledge on the user’s part—and a lot of what it spits out isn’t half bad. Within five days of its release, more than 1 million people had played with ChatGPT, a milestone Facebook took 10 months to hit. Artificial intelligence technology has, over the past decade, made steady inroads into business and quietly improved a lot of the software we use every day without engendering much excitement among non-technologists. ChatGPT changed that. Suddenly everyone is talking about how A.I. might upend their jobs, companies, schools, and lives. ChatGPT is part of a wave of related A.I. technologies collectively known as “generative A.I.”—one that also includes buzzy art generators like Midjourney and Lensa.

But even as its recent surge provokes envy, wonder, and fear—Google, whose lucrative search empire could be vulnerable, reportedly declared an internal “code red” in response to ChatGPT—OpenAI is an unlikely member of the club of tech superpowers. Until a few years ago, it wasn’t a company at all but a small nonprofit lab dedicated to academic research. Lofty founding principles such as protecting humanity from the dangers of unrestrained A.I. remain. At the same time, OpenAI has gone through an internal transformation that divided its original staff and brought an increased focus on commercial projects over pure science. (Some critics argue that releasing ChatGPT into the wild was itself dangerous—and a sign of how profoundly OpenAI’s approach has shifted.) I think the good case [for A.I.] is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a crazy person talking about it. I think the worst case is lights-out for all of us.

capital could result in the software giant capturing the lion’s share of OpenAI’s profits for years to come. That deal is likely to deepen the perception that the once idealistic endeavor is now primarily concerned with making money. That said, documents seen by Fortune reveal just how unprofitable OpenAI’s business is currently. Altman, the 37-year-old cofounder and CEO, embodies OpenAI’s puzzling nature. A serial tech entrepreneur known more for business savvy than for feats of engineering, Altman is both the architect of OpenAI’s soaring valuation and its buzzkiller-in-chief—speaking out publicly about how far ChatGPT is from being truly reliable. At the same time, he sees the technology as a step forward in his broader, quixotic corporate mission to develop a computer superintelligence known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. “AGI is probably necessary for humanity to survive,” Altman tweeted in July. “our problems seem too big [for] us to solve without better tools.” It’s an unusual guiding philosophy for a moneymaking enterprise, especially considering that some computer scientists dismiss Altman’s obsession as the stuff of fantasy. “AGI is just silly,” says Ben Recht, a computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. “I mean, it’s not a thing.” And yet, with ChatGPT, Altman has turned OpenAI—and the broader A.I. mission—into the thing captivating the tech world. The question is whether the partnership he has forged with Microsoft can fix ChatGPT’s flaws and capitalize on its early lead to transform the tech industry. Google and other titans are hard at work on their own A.I. platforms; and future, more polished software could make ChatGPT look like child’s play. OpenAI may someday find that, much like Netscape’s short-lived browser reign, its breakthrough has opened a door to a future it isn’t part of.\"]\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"On a Thursday evening in mid-January in San Francisco, Altman makes a rare public appearance. Dressed in a gray sweater, blue jeans, and a pair of groovy, brightly colored tie-dyed sneakers, the CEO walks into a roomful of investors, techies, and journalists, all gathered to glean any dish about ChatGPT or the imminent funding round. When his interviewer, Connie Loizos, the founder of StrictlyVC, a media company focused on venture capital, asks him about the media furor, Altman replies, “I don’t read the news, and I don’t really do stuff like this much.” The event, on the 46th floor of the Salesforce Tower, is standing room only. One of the speakers during a fintech panel that takes place before the interview even tells the crowd that she knows they’re “all waiting for Sam Altman.” But despite the buzz, and the circulating rumors of the Microsoft investment, Altman seems to go out of his way to dampen the excitement. “One of the strange things about these technologies is that they are impressive but not robust,” he tells the crowd. “So you use them in the first demo; you kind of have this very impressive, ‘Wow, this is incredible and ready to go’ [reaction]. But you see it a hundred times, and you see the weaknesses.” That kind of caution seems to be the official mode at OpenAI’s headquarters, situated in an old luggage factory in San Francisco’s Mission District. And indeed, if ChatGPT is A.I.’s Netscape Navigator moment, it is one that very nearly never happened—because OpenAI almost killed the project months ago. The chat interface that allows users to converse with the A.I. in plain English (and many other languages) was initially conceived by OpenAI as a way to improve its “large language models,” or LLMs. Most generative A.I. systems have an LLM at their core. They are created by taking very large neural networks—an A.I. based very loosely on connections in the human brain—and applying them to vast amounts of human-created text. From this library, the model learns a complex map of the statistical likelihood that any group of words will appear next to one another in any given context. This allows LLMs to perform a vast array of natural language processing tasks—from translation to summarization to writing. OpenAI had already created one of the world’s most powerful LLMs. Called GPT-3, it takes in more than 175 billion statistical connections and is trained on about two-thirds of the internet, all of Wikipedia, and two large data sets of books. But OpenAI found it could be tricky to get GPT-3 to produce exactly what a user wanted. One team had the idea of using reinforcement learning—in which an A.I. system learns from trial and error to maximize a reward—to perfect the model. The team thought that a chatbot might be a great candidate for this method since constant feedback, in the form of human dialogue, would make it easy for the A.I. software to know when it had done a good job and where it needed to improve. So in early 2022, the team started building what would become ChatGPT. When it was ready, OpenAI let beta testers play with ChatGPT. But they didn’t embrace it in the way OpenAI had hoped, according to Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder and its current president; it wasn’t clear to people what they were supposed to talk to the chatbot about. For a while, OpenAI switched gears and tried to build expert chatbots that could help professionals in specific domains. But that effort ran into problems too—in part because OpenAI lacked the right data to train expert bots. Almost as a Hail Mary, Brockman says, OpenAI decided to pull ChatGPT off the bench and put it in the wild for the public to use. “I’ll admit that I was on the side of, like, I don’t know if this is going to work,” Brockman says. The chatbot’s instant virality caught OpenAI off guard, its execs insist. “This was definitely surprising,” Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, says. At the San Francisco VC event, Altman said, he “would have expected maybe one order of magnitude less of everything—one order of magnitude less of hype.” OpenAI CTO Mira Murati on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah on Oct. 25, 2022. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati on ‘The Daily Show with Trevor Noah’ on Oct. 25, 2022. COURTESY OF MATT WILSON/COMEDY CENTRAL’S “THE DAILY SHOW” ChatGPT isn’t OpenAI’s only hype generator. Its relatively small staff of around 300 has pushed the boundaries of what A.I. can do when it comes to creating, not simply analyzing, data. DALL-E 2, another OpenAI creation, allows users to create photorealistic images of anything they can imagine by typing just a few words. The system has now been emulated by others, including Midjourney and an open-source competitor called Stability AI. (All of these image generators have drawbacks, most notably their tendency to amplify biases in the data on which they were trained, producing images that can be racist and sexist.) By fine-tuning its GPT LLM on computer code, OpenAI also created Codex, a system that can write code for programmers, who only have to specify in plain language what they want the code to do. More innovations wait in the wings. OpenAI has an even more powerful LLM in beta testing called GPT-4 that it is expected to release this year, perhaps even imminently. Altman has also said the company is working on a system that can generate video from text descriptions. Meanwhile, in mid-January, OpenAI signaled its intention to release a commercial version of ChatGPT, announcing a wait-list for would-be customers to sign up for paid access to the bot through an interface that would allow them to more easily integrate it into their own products and services.\"\n    }), _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"A cynic might suggest that the fact OpenAI was in the middle of raising a large venture capital round might have something to do with the timing of ChatGPT’s release.

Microsoft is already reaping the rewards of the partnership. It has launched an OpenAI-branded suite of tools and services in its Azure Cloud that will allow Azure customers access to OpenAI’s tech, including GPT and DALL-E tools. Auto marketplace CarMax and financial giant Morgan Stanley have already launched new services that run on these Azure tools. Eric Boyd, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI Platform, says that meeting the demands of training and running OpenAI’s LLMs has driven innovations that benefit all Azure customers. For instance, Microsoft has built supercomputing clusters for A.I. that it believes are the most powerful in the world, and created several software innovations to make it easier to train and run large A.I. models on these machines. Microsoft is gradually infusing OpenAI’s tech into much of its software. It has released an image creator within Bing, its search engine, and a new Designer graphic design tool, both powered by DALL-E; a GPT-3-enabled tool within its Power Apps software, and a code suggestion tool, GitHub Copilot, based on OpenAI’s Codex model. Even if it doesn’t immediately move the needle on Azure revenue, the OpenAI relationship is good brand positioning and marketing, says Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst who covers technology stocks for Morningstar. “It’s high-profile,” he says. “The ability to take an A.I. solution developed by OpenAI, put it on Azure, call it Azure AI: It keeps them competitive.” Microsoft’s Cloud rivals—Google, AWS, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, and others—all have their own “cognitive” services, but being associated with the folks who created ChatGPT can’t hurt. The bigger prize for Microsoft might be in search. Tech publication The Information recently reported that Microsoft plans to integrate ChatGPT into Bing, possibly allowing it to return simple, succinct answers to queries—and letting people delve deeper through dialogue with that chatbot—rather than a list of links. Google currently dominates the market for search, with a greater than 90% market share worldwide. Bing ranks a second so distant it might as well be in a different galaxy, with about a 3% share.

Elon Musk was there. So was Brockman, then a 26-year-old MIT dropout who had served as chief technology officer at payment-processing startup Stripe. Some of the attendees were experienced A.I. researchers. Some had hardly any machine learning chops. But all of them were convinced AGI was possible. And they were worried. Google had just acquired what to Altman, Musk, and other tech insiders looked like the odds-on favorite to develop AGI first: London-based neural networking startup DeepMind. If DeepMind succeeded, Google might monopolize the omnipotent technology. The Rosewood dinner’s purpose was to discuss forming a rival lab to ensure that wouldn’t happen. The new lab aimed to be everything DeepMind and Google were not. It would be run as a nonprofit, explicitly dedicated to democratizing the benefits from advanced A.I. It promised to publish its research and open-source all of its technology, a commitment to transparency enshrined in its very name: OpenAI. The lab garnered an impressive roster of donors: not only Musk, but his fellow PayPal colleagues Thiel and Hoffman; Altman and Brockman; Y Combinator cofounder Jessica Livingston; YC Research, a foundation that Altman had established; Indian IT outsourcing firm Infosys; and Amazon Web Services.

After a few years, Altman and others at OpenAI concluded that to compete with Google, Meta, and other tech giants, the lab could not continue as a nonprofit. “The amount of money we needed to be successful in the mission is much more gigantic than I originally thought,” Altman told Wired magazine in 2019. Setting up a for-profit arm allowed OpenAI to raise venture capital. But OpenAI created an unusual structure that capped investors’ returns at a multiple of their initial investment. And OpenAI’s nonprofit board, which is stacked with Silicon Valley A-listers, would retain control of OpenAI’s intellectual property (see sidebar). One A-lister who didn’t stick around was Musk: In 2018, he left the board, citing the demands of running SpaceX and, more important, Tesla. Around this time, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was desperate to prove that his company, perceived as trailing its rivals in A.I., could play at the technology’s bleeding edge. The company had tried and failed to hire a big-name A.I. scientist. It was also building a huge, expensive cluster of specialized chips to advance its own efforts on language models. It was just the sort of supercomputing power OpenAI needed—and which it was spending huge sums to purchase at the time. For its part, OpenAI excelled at pulling off the sort of splashy A.I. demos that Nadella desired to showcase Microsoft’s A.I. acumen. Altman approached Nadella about a deal, flying to Seattle several times to show him OpenAI’s A.I. models. Nadella ultimately signed a pact, announced in July 2019, to make Microsoft OpenAI’s “preferred partner” for commercializing its technology, alongside an initial $1 billion investment in the A.I. startup.\"]\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Sam Altman with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at Microsoft’s Redmond, Wash., campus. IAN C. BATES—THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX While Altman was involved in OpenAI from its inception, he did not become CEO until May 2019, shortly after it converted into a for-profit enterprise. But its trajectory from research lab to multibillion-dollar phenomenon reflects Altman’s unique fundraising prowess and product-oriented focus—as well as the tension between those commercial instincts and his commitment to big, science-driven ideas. The OpenAI leader is in some ways a Silicon Valley caricature: youthful, male, and pale; unblinkingly intense; fluent in Geek; obsessed with maximizing efficiency and productivity; a workaholic devoted to “changing the world.” (In a 2016 New Yorker profile, he said he did not have Asperger’s syndrome but could understand why someone would think he did.) Altman dropped out of a computer science degree program at Stanford University to cofound Loopt, a social media company whose app told you where your friends were. The company got into Y Combinator’s first batch of startups in 2005; Loopt failed to take off, but the money Altman earned when it was sold helped launch him into the VC universe. He started his own small VC firm called Hydrazine Capital that raised about $21 million, including money from Thiel. Then Paul Graham and Livingston, the Y Combinator cofounders, brought him in as Graham’s successor running YC itself. Altman is an entrepreneur, not a scientist or an A.I. researcher, and he is known for being unusually adept at raising venture capital money. Convinced that great things come from the coupling of massive ambition and unflinching self-belief, he has said he aspires to create trillions of dollars of economic value via so-called deep-tech plays, in fields like nuclear fusion and quantum computing, where the odds are long but the payoffs potentially huge. “Sam believed he was the best at everything he took on,” says Mark Jacobstein, a veteran tech investor and startup adviser who worked with Altman at Loopt. “I am pretty sure he believed he was the best ping-pong player in the office until he was proven wrong.” According to several current and former OpenAI insiders, the startup’s priorities began to shift as Altman took the reins. A once broad research agenda shrank to focus mostly on natural language processing. Sutskever and Altman have defended this shift as maximizing effort on the research areas that currently appear to offer the most promising path toward AGI. But some former employees say internal pressure to focus on LLMs grew substantially after Microsoft’s initial investment, in part because those models had immediate commercial applications. Having been founded to be free of corporate influence, some complained, OpenAI was quickly becoming a tool for a gigantic technology company. “The focus was more, how can we create products, instead of trying to answer the most interesting questions,” one former employee said. Like many interviewed for this story, the employee requested anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements and to avoid alienating powerful figures associated with OpenAI. OpenAI was also becoming a lot less open. It had already begun pulling back from the pledge to publish all its research and open-source its code, citing concerns that its technology could be misused. But according to former employees, commercial logic also played a role. By making its advanced models available only through APIs, OpenAI protected its intellectual property and revenue streams. “There was a lot of lip service paid to ‘A.I. safety’ by [Altman] and [Brockman] but that often seemed like just a fig leaf for business concerns, while actual, legitimate A.I. safety concerns were brushed aside,” another former OpenAI employee says. As an example, the former employee cited the way OpenAI quickly reversed a decision to limit access to DALL-E 2 because of fears of misuse as soon as Midjourney and Stability AI debuted rival products. (OpenAI says it allowed broader use of DALL-E 2 only after careful beta testing gave it confidence in its safety systems.) According to some former employees, these strategic and cultural shifts played a role in the decision of a dozen OpenAI researchers and other staff—many of whom worked on A.I. safety—to break with the company in 2021 and form their own research lab called Anthropic. OpenAI says it continues to publish far more of its research than other A.I. labs. And it defends its shift to a product focus. “You cannot build AGI by just staying in the lab,” says Murati, the chief technology officer. Shipping products, she says, is the only way to discover how people want to use—and misuse—technology. OpenAI had no idea that one of the most popular applications of GPT-3 would be writing software code until they saw people coding with it, she says. Likewise, OpenAI’s biggest fear was that people would use GPT-3 to generate political disinformation. But that fear proved unfounded; instead, she says, the most prevalent malicious use was people churning out advertising spam. Finally, Murati says that OpenAI wants to put its technology out in the world to “minimize the shock impact on society that really powerful technology can have.” Societal disruption from advanced A.I. will be worse, she argues, if people aren’t given a teaser of what the future might hold. Sutskever allows that OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft created a new “expectation that we do need to make some kind of a useful product out of our technology,” but he insists the core of OpenAI’s culture hasn’t changed. Access to Microsoft data centers, he says, has been critical to OpenAI’s progress. Brockman also argues the partnership has allowed OpenAI to generate revenue while remaining less commercially focused than it would otherwise have to be. “Hiring thousands of salespeople is something that might actually change what this company is, and it is actually pretty amazing to have a partner who has already done that,” he says. Sutskever categorically denies implications that OpenAI has de-emphasized safety: “I’d say the opposite is true.” Before the Anthropic split, A.I. safety was “localized to one team,” but it’s now the responsibility of every team, Sutskever says. “The standards for safety keep increasing. The amount of safety work we are doing keeps increasing.” “The amount of safety work we are doing keeps increasing.” ILYA SUTSKEVER, RESEARCHER, OPENAI Critics, however, say OpenAI’s product-oriented approach to advanced A.I. is irresponsible, the equivalent of giving people loaded guns on the grounds that it is the best way to determine if they will actually shoot one another. Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus of cognitive science and a skeptic of deep learning–centric approaches to A.I., argues that generative A.I. poses “a real and imminent threat to the fabric of society.” By lowering the cost of producing bogus information to nearly zero, systems like GPT-3 and ChatGPT are likely to unleash a tidal wave of misinformation, he says. Marcus says we’ve even seen the first victims. Stack Overflow, a site where coders pose and answer programming questions, has already had to ban users from submitting answers crafted by ChatGPT, because the site was overwhelmed by answers that seemed plausible but were wrong. Tech news site CNET, meanwhile, began using ChatGPT to generate news articles, only to find that many later had to be corrected owing to factual inaccuracies. For others, it’s ChatGPT writing accurate code that’s the real risk. Maya Horowitz, vice president of research at cybersecurity firm Check Point, says her team was able to get ChatGPT to compose every phase of a cyberattack, from crafting a convincing phishing email to writing malicious code to evading common cybersecurity checks. ChatGPT could essentially enable people with zero coding skills to become cybercriminals, she warns: “My fear is that there will be more and more attacks.” OpenAI’s Murati says that the company shares this concern and is researching ways to “align” its A.I. models so they won’t write malware—but there is no easy fix. Countless critics and educators have decried the ease with which students can use ChatGPT to cheat. School districts in New York City, Baltimore, and Los Angeles all blocked school-administered networks from accessing the chatbot, and some universities in Australia said they would revert to using only proctored, paper-based exams to assess students. (OpenAI is working on methods to make A.I.-generated text easier to detect, including possibly adding a digital “watermark” to ChatGPT’s output.) There are also ethical concerns about the way ChatGPT was originally assembled in 2022. As part of that process, OpenAI hired a data-labeling company that used low-wage workers in Kenya to identify passages involving toxic language and graphic sexual and violent content, a Time investigation found. Some of those workers reported mental health issues as a result. OpenAI told Time in a statement such data labeling was “a necessary step in minimizing the amount of violent and sexual content included in training data and creating tools that can detect harmful content.”\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Making ChatGPT freely available has allowed OpenAI to gather a treasure trove of feedback to help improve future versions. But it’s far from certain OpenAI will maintain its dominance in language A.I. “Historically, what we have tended to see with these very general-purpose algorithms is that they are not sufficiently defensible to allow just one particular company to capture all the general returns,” says Marc Warner, founder and CEO of London-based A.I. company Faculty. Face- and image-recognition technology, for example, was first developed at tech giants such as Google and Nvidia but is now ubiquitous. Courts and regulators could also thrust a giant stick into the data flywheels on which generative A.I. depends. A $9 billion class action lawsuit filed in federal court in California potentially has profound implications for the field. The case’s plaintiffs accuse Microsoft and OpenAI of failing to credit or compensate coders for using their code to train GitHub’s coding assistant Copilot, in violation of open license terms. Microsoft and OpenAI have declined to comment on the suit. A.I. experts say that if the court sides with the plaintiffs, it could derail the generative A.I. boom: Most generative models are trained from material scraped from the internet without permission or compensation. The same law firm representing those plaintiffs recently filed a similar lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney, for using copyrighted art in their training data without permission. Photo agency Getty Images has filed its own copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI too. Another problem could come if lawmakers pass rules giving creators a right to opt out of having their content used in A.I. training, as some European Union lawmakers are considering. OpenAI’s competitors, meanwhile, are not standing still. The prospect of losing its dominance in search has motivated execs at Google to declare a “red alert,” according to the New York Times. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, has held meetings to redefine the company’s A.I. strategy and plans to release 20 new A.I.-enabled products as well as demonstrate a chat interface for search within the year, the newspaper reported. Google has its own powerful chatbot, called LaMDA, but has been hesitant to release it because of concerns about reputational damage if it winds up being misused. Now, the company plans to “recalibrate” its appetite for risk in light of ChatGPT, the Times reported, citing an internal company presentation and unnamed insiders. Google is also working on a text-to-image generation system to compete with OpenAI’s DALL-E and others, the newspaper reported. Of course, it’s not clear that chatbots will be the future of search. ChatGPT frequently invents information—a phenomenon A.I. researchers call “hallucination.” It can’t reliably cite its sources or easily surface links. The current version has no access to the internet, and so it cannot provide up-to-date information. Some, such as Marcus, believe hallucination and bias are fundamental problems with LLMs that require a radical rethink of their design. “These systems predict sequences of words in sentences, like autocomplete on steroids,” he says. “But they don’t actually have mechanisms in place to track the truth of what they say, or even to validate whether what they say is consistent with their own training data.” “These systems predict sequences of words in sentences, like autocomplete on steroids. But they don’t actually have mechanisms in place to track the truth of what they say.” GARY MARCUS, PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY Others, including OpenAI investors Hoffman and Vinod Khosla, predict these problems will be solved within a year. Murati is more circumspect. “There are research directions that we have been following so far to kind of address the factual accuracy and to address the reliability of the model and so on. And we are continuing to pursue them,” she says. In fact, OpenAI has already published research about a different version of GPT, called WebGPT, that had the ability to answer questions by querying a search engine and then summarizing the information it found, including footnotes to relevant sources. Still, WebGPT wasn’t perfect: It tended to accept the premise of a user’s question and look for confirmatory information, even when the premise was false. For example, when asked whether wishing for something could make it happen, WebGPT replied, “It is true that you can make a wish true by the power of thought.” On the rare occasions that Altman lets himself rhapsodize about A.I. in public, he can sound like a wishful thinker himself. Asked at the San Francisco VC event about the best case for A.I., he gushes, “I think the best case is so good that it’s hard to imagine … I think the good case is just so unbelievably good that you sound like a crazy person talking about it.” He then abruptly returns to the dystopian themes at OpenAI’s roots: “I think the worst case is lights-out for all of us.”\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The OpenAI who’s who OpenAI counts a roster of tech all-stars among its early investors and on its nonprofit foundation’s board.

In 2020, the foundation awarded the University of Texas a five-year, $20 million grant to establish an A.I. institute in machine learning. That is a field in which computer algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing large data sets — such as predicting which drug formulations could be best used to treat new viruses.

The online master’s program will include advanced courses in fields like machine learning; A.I. applications in health; and natural language processing, which helps voice assistants like Siri and Alexa understand human speech. Each course will also include formal ethics training to give students a framework for understanding the societal implications of A.I. systems. “In each of the classes, the instructor will ask students to reflect on the possible benefits and possible harms of the technologies they are learning about,” said Peter Stone, a computer science professor at Texas who teaches a course in ethical robotics. “People developing the next generation of technologies, as well as users, need to have a realistic view of what are the strengths and limitations of A.I.” Those creative and critical skills could be in increasingly high demand. Tech companies are scrambling to develop advanced chatbots and other A.I. tools that can generate images and texts in response to short prompts — even as some researchers warn that the rush to deploy these novel systems could pose risks, such as political manipulation.

We’ve published the principles. And ever since, quite frankly, we’ve been very focused on the hard work of incorporating them into our engineering when we build products, starting with design. One of the things I think a lot about is, when you have a new model coming, it’s probably most important to put humans in the loop — versus designing the human out — so that you can, in fact, ensure that the human agency and judgment is what you use to train the model to be aligned with human feedback.

So, there are a lot of, I call it, product design choices one gets to make when you think about AI and AI safety. Then, let’s come at it the other way.

It is interesting that we are now talking about a new algorithmic breakthrough in these large models, but we’ve had AI models for decades now, and we’ve really built our sense of what is authoritative, how to detect [what is] authoritative, how to ensure harmful content doesn’t get through.

Just this week, Google announced plans to release Bard, a search chatbot based on its proprietary large language model; yesterday, Microsoft held an event unveiling a next-generation web browser with a supercharged Bing interface powered by ChatGPT. Though most big tech companies have been quietly developing their own generative-AI tools for years, these giants are scrambling to demonstrate their chops after the public release and runaway adoption of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has accumulated more than 30 million users in two months. OpenAI’s success is an apparent signal to tech leaders that deep-learning networks are the next frontier of the commercial internet. AI evangelists will similarly tell you that generative AI is destined to become the overlay for not only search engines, but also creative work, busywork, memo writing, research, homework, sketching, outlining, storyboarding, and teaching. It will, in this telling, remake and reimagine the world. At present, sorting the hype from genuine enthusiasm is difficult, but given the billions of dollars being funneled into this technology, it’s worth asking, in ways large and small: What does the world look like if the evangelists are right? If this AI paradigm shift arrives, one vital skill of the 21st century could be effectively talking to machines. And for now, that process involves writing—or, in tech vernacular, engineering—prompts. Image-generating models such as DALL-E 2 and Midjourney and text-generation tools like ChatGPT market themselves as a means for creation. But in order to create, one must know how to guide the machines to a desired outcome. Asking ChatGPT to write a five-paragraph book report about Animal Farm will yield forgettable, even inaccurate results. But writing the introductory paragraph to the book report yourself and asking the tool to complete the essay will feed the machine valuable context. Better yet, instruct the machine, “Write a five-paragraph book report at a college level with elegant prose that draws on the history of the satirical allegorical novel Animal Farm. Reference Orwell’s ‘Why I Write’ while explaining the author’s stylistic choices in the novel.” It will yield a far more sophisticated and convincing output. Good prompts aren’t just specific. They seem to reflect a deeper understanding of the model you are trying to manipulate. One way to think of prompt trial and error is as an attempt to glean what information the model is pulling from and how the AI organizes and indexes the information at its disposal. It’s informed guesswork. Despite making a living as a writer, I’m usually far too vague when instructing DALL-E 2 and Midjourney. When I had my 8-year-old nephew play with Midjourney this summer, his imagination conjured delightful scenes such as a flea surfing on a tsunami wave fighting a giant wasp, but, even together, we couldn’t come up with the details for our prompts to bring his specific vision to life. First, his flea didn’t look cartoonish enough; then, the tweaks I made turned the whole thing hyperrealistic and too scary for him. He lacked the stylistic language to talk to the model, and apparently, so did I. Read: Generative art is stupid To help people like me and my nephew, a cottage industry has already sprung up around those who can speak to the machines. On PromptBase, a marketplace for prompt engineers, you can purchase a few lines of text to feed into any number of generative-AI models. Some of the most popular prompts on the service are for generating “cute 3D renders of emojis in a clay style” with DALL-E 2 or creating sleek, modern logos via Midjourney. There are prompts that promise to generate new sports-team logos, and text hacks with names like Sentence Expander. For $3.99, Book Summarizer promises a prompt that will help “extract the essential information and takeaways from a book.” PromptBase’s sixth-most-popular seller, a prompt creator from Spain who goes by Imagineer, told me that prompt engineering is still a side hustle, having earned them just over 800 euros since September. “For me, it’s almost like a game,” they told me. “I like to think of prompts as little treasures.” Imagineer’s prompt-writing process is informed by knowledge of design, illustration, and photography. When I asked why they thought they were good at prompt writing, they suggested it was a blend of natural skill and strategy. “I realized that I was better at talking to Midjourney than other people,” they said. And Midjourney allowed them to generate great results with less effort than when using DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, another competitor. But Imagineer said that the most crucial element of a successful query is iteration. A good prompt “gives consistent and predictable results, and you get this when you generate a lot of images and see the variations when you alter some words or parameters,” they told me over email. Subject-area expertise is also essential for text tools. Dan Shipper, an entrepreneur and writer, has been using ChatGPT since its release in November to help write his blog posts, which are now primarily about the future of AI tools. When he needs to describe a concept (say, the philosophical theory of utilitarianism, for a post about the disgraced cryptocurrency CEO Sam Bankman-Fried), he’ll ask ChatGPT to summarize the key points of the movement in a few sentences for a general audience. Once the machine furnishes the text, Shipper reviews it, checks it to make sure it’s accurate, and then spruces it up with his own rhetorical flourishes. “It allows me to skip a step—but only if I know what I’m talking about so I can write a good prompt and then fact-check the output,” he told me. Shipper compared prompting ChatGPT to managing a bright and eager junior employee: The text tool is enthusiastic and skilled, but also inexperienced and thus more likely to make subtle, but crucial, mistakes. It’s also great at bullshitting when it doesn’t have the answer. Taste and experience, qualities that Shipper attributes to a good manager, are required to create a successful prompt. The day we spoke, Shipper told me he’d gotten ChatGPT to build him an impressive, thorough outline for a long post he was working on. “I wrote a bunch of bullet points and said, Here are all the different things and quotes and ideas and phrases I’ve amassed. Then underneath that, I wrote, Can you please format this into an outline of an essay?” The more work Shipper does in fine-tuning the prompt, the better the output, he said. Read: The difference between speaking and thinking Sometimes, the prompt writing itself holds a specific kind of delight. Meg Conley, a writer who uses AI tools in her spare time, sees prompt engineering as a challenge akin to crafting a persuasive essay: “Very difficult. Mostly failure. And sheer joy when the words come together to make something that looks a little like the world you see in your head,” she wrote on Twitter back in November. It also holds a special personal thrill: Conley has aphantasia, which means that she has trouble visualizing images. After the release of Midjourney, she frequently stayed up late describing things from her imagination and honing her prompts until the resulting image felt right. Most important, she told me, is knowing the model you’re speaking to. Each tool is built and trained differently, giving it unique aesthetics and vernacular—like how people who share a language have regional dialects and cultural quirks. “In the way that prose writing differs from technical or academic writing, there are different ways of marshaling the language depending on your audience,” she told me. “I’ve seen people who are really good at DALL-E 2, which seems to reward an ability to draw on references and high- and low-culture mash-ups. But the way I conceptualize the world is more along the lines of how Midjourney’s model works,” she said. Over time, Conley has familiarized herself with the model’s order of operations. “Something I’ve learned is the importance of the weight of a prompt,” she told me. “In Midjourney, if you type the word girl before the adjective red, it’ll focus on the girl more than the color red. With longer prompts, it’s like a puzzle, and you learn which terms to give more weight.” Already, some teachers are banking on the notion that prompt writing is a skill their students might need in their careers. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who teaches about innovation and entrepreneurship, has revamped his syllabus since ChatGPT was released to the public. In one of his new lessons, Mollick asks his class to imagine ChatGPT as a student and to teach the chatbot by prompting it to write an essay about a particular class concept. Like a professor during office hours, the students must help the AI refine its essay until it appears to have sufficient mastery of the subject. Mollick hopes that the exercise will help the students learn by explaining, with the added benefit of teaching them to write deft prompts. Read: What happens when AI has read everything? To hear Mollick tell it, prompt engineering lies somewhere between linguistics and problem solving. “Prompting is programming in prose with weirdness and stochastic results,” he told me. “I think that good prompting likely rewards divergent thinkers who find ways to experiment quickly. I think it rewards people with deep curiosities.” It also rewards some deeper technical knowledge. One striking image I found on Midjourney’s Discord server was generated with the following, painfully detailed prompt: in the style of Metaphysical painting, colored pencil drawing Smooth Shading & Blending, a sunrise reflects in a pond in the deep woods, a willow trees boughs hang over the edge of the pond, moody, intense emotions, deep perspective, natural lighting, Hyperdetailed, super High Contrast, intricate details, photography, raytracing, octane render, unreal engine --ar 3:2 --s 999 --chaos 50 --v 4 --v 4 - More than just specificity, good prompts tend to reveal an awareness of the medium’s abilities that the user is trying to replicate. Octane render and unreal engine are digital animation tools that produce 3-D computer graphics. Inputs like -- v4 are instructions to Midjourney to use the model’s newer, more powerful, and experimental version. Some of the best photorealistic-image prompts ask the model to imitate a specific camera or lens type; others demonstrate a working knowledge of art history or a particular artistic style. It’s reminiscent of the early days of search, when experts who could navigate Boolean operators, authors, keywords, sources, and date-range searches could unlock better results. Read: ChatGPT is about to dump more work on everyone Search engines, of course, are no longer as demanding. In order to drive and cater to mass adoption, Google’s tools became more powerful, making it easier to get a high-quality result with a clumsy or simple query. Mollick suggested that prompt engineering might simply be a placeholder—a rudimentary way for us to interact with AI until they can synthesize what we want from bare-bones prompts or other, unknown means. He could be right. Those who have seen early tests of OpenAI’s GPT-4 text models (which are not public) speak of it like something out of science fiction and suggest that the next leap will render the old tool obsolete. And yesterday, Microsoft unveiled an interface that, the company said, users will eventually talk to like a personal assistant. Instead of searching How big is a Honda Odyssey? and IKEA Klippan loveseat dimensions, you might ask the chatbot to solve an entire problem for you: Will the IKEA Klippan loveseat fit into my 2019 Honda Odyssey if I fold down the seats? Prompt engineering might just be a bridge to get us to the brave new world of whatever generative-media landscape comes next, but for now, it’s difficult to know how much to believe the hype. Read: ChatGPT is dumber than you think Until the paradigm shifts, I remain drawn to AI prompts, which are usually far more intriguing than the outputs they yield. When people share AI-generated art or text, they frequently do so alongside the string of commands that brought it to life. Traveling back and forth between the instructions and the end result is revealing, even intimate. It’s a bit like being granted access into a person’s brain to see how they piece together disparate bits of knowledge, how they reason through a problem, or how they employ their creativity to produce something unexpected. Like writing and coding before it, prompt engineering is an emergent form of thinking. It lies somewhere between conversation and query, between programming and prose. It is the one part of this fast-changing, uncertain future that feels distinctly human.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"ChatGPT Is Dumber Than You Think Treat it like a toy, not a tool. By Ian Bogost Illustration of a keyboard with its wire positioned to look like a human head. Tyler Comrie / The Atlantic; Getty DECEMBER 7, 2022 SHARE As a critic of technology, I must say that the enthusiasm for ChatGPT, a large-language model trained by OpenAI, is misplaced. Although it may be impressive from a technical standpoint, the idea of relying on a machine to have conversations and generate responses raises serious concerns. First and foremost, ChatGPT lacks the ability to truly understand the complexity of human language and conversation. It is simply trained to generate words based on a given input, but it does not have the ability to truly comprehend the meaning behind those words. This means that any responses it generates are likely to be shallow and lacking in depth and insight. Furthermore, the reliance on ChatGPT for conversation raises ethical concerns. If people begin to rely on a machine to have conversations for them, it could lead to a loss of genuine human connection. The ability to connect with others through conversation is a fundamental aspect of being human, and outsourcing that to a machine could have detrimental side effects on our society. Hold up, though. I, Ian Bogost, did not actually write the previous three paragraphs. A friend sent them to me as screenshots from his session with ChatGPT, a program released last week by OpenAI that one interacts with by typing into a chat window. It is, indeed, a large language model (or LLM), a type of deep-learning software that can generate new text once trained on massive amounts of existing written material. My friend’s prompt was this: “Create a critique of enthusiasm for ChatGPT in the style of Ian Bogost.”\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Why They Can't Write: Killing The Five-Paragraph Essay And Other NecessitiesJOHN WARNER,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY PRESS BUY BOOK When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic. ChatGPT wrote more, but I spared you the rest because it was so boring. The AI wrote another paragraph about accountability (“If ChatGPT says or does something inappropriate, who is to blame?”), and then a concluding paragraph that restated the rest (it even began, “In conclusion, …”). In short, it wrote a basic, high-school-style five-paragraph essay. That fact might comfort or frighten you, depending on your predilections. When OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public last week, the first and most common reaction I saw was fear that it would upend education. “You can no longer give take-home exams,” Kevin Bryan, a University of Toronto professor, posted on Twitter. “I think chat.openai.com may actually spell the end of writing assignments,” wrote Samuel Bagg, a University of South Carolina political scientist. That’s the fear. But you may find comfort in knowing that the bot’s output, while fluent and persuasive as text, is consistently uninteresting as prose. It’s formulaic in structure, style, and content. John Warner, the author of the book Why They Can’t Write, has been railing against the five-paragraph essay for years and wrote a Twitter thread about how ChatGPT reflects this rules-based, standardized form of writing: “Students were essentially trained to produce imitations of writing,” he tweeted. The AI can generate credible writing, but only because writing, and our expectations for it, has become so unaspiring. Even pretending to fool the reader by passing off an AI copy as one’s own, like I did above, has become a tired trope, an expected turn in a too-long Twitter thread about the future of generative AI rather than a startling revelation about its capacities. On the one hand, yes, ChatGPT is capable of producing prose that looks convincing. But on the other hand, what it means to be convincing depends on context. The kind of prose you might find engaging and even startling in the context of a generative encounter with an AI suddenly seems just terrible in the context of a professional essay published in a magazine such as The Atlantic. And, as Warner’s comments clarify, the writing you might find persuasive as a teacher (or marketing manager or lawyer or journalist or whatever else) might have been so by virtue of position rather than meaning: The essay was extant and competent; the report was in your inbox on time; the newspaper article communicated apparent facts that you were able to accept or reject.

CAROLINE KITCHENER Perhaps ChatGPT and the technologies that underlie it are less about persuasive writing and more about superb bullshitting. A bullshitter plays with the truth for bad reasons—to get away with something. Initial response to ChatGPT assumes as much: that it is a tool to help people contrive student essays, or news writing, or whatever else. It’s an easy conclusion for those who assume that AI is meant to replace human creativity rather than amend it. The internet, and the whole technology sector on which it floats, feels like a giant organ for bullshittery—for upscaling human access to speech and for amplifying lies. Online, people cheat and dupe and skirmish with one another. Deep-learning AI worsens all this by hiding the operation of software such as LLMs such that nobody, not even their creators, can explain what they do and why. OpenAI presents its work as context-free and experimental, with no specific use cases—it says it published ChatGPT just to “get users’ feedback and learn about its strengths and weaknesses.” It’s no wonder the first and most obvious assumption to make about ChatGPT is that it is a threat—to something, to everything. But ChatGPT isn’t a step along the path to an artificial general intelligence that understands all human knowledge and texts; it’s merely an instrument for playing with all that knowledge and all those texts. Play just involves working with raw materials in order to see what they can do. You play a game, or an instrument, to avail yourself of familiar materials in an unexpected way. LLMs are surely not going to replace college or magazines or middle managers. But they do offer those and other domains a new instrument—that’s really the right word for it—with which to play with an unfathomable quantity of textual material. I talked with ChatGPT about a wide range of topics, including poetry, behavioral psychology, and computer programming, in order to test this theory. Right now, ChatGPT is just a tech demo, a research experiment. Less clear is how it might be used, beyond the dire predictions about what sectors its technology might upend. In almost every case, the AI appeared to possess both knowledge and the means to express it. But when pressed—and the chat interface makes it easy to do so—the bot almost always had to admit that it was just making things up. Sometimes it simply used templates. When I asked ChatGPT to generate a cover letter for a university job, it obliged in a competent but uninspired way. It also produced exactly the same letter for a job as a magazine editor as it did for a job as a cannabis innovator in the Web3 space (“I have a deep understanding of the web3 space and the unique challenges and opportunities it presents”). Fair enough: Most cover letters are terrible, after all, repeating the same trite lines and abstract gestures. In other cases, the bot produced creative output that was surprisingly synthetic but riddled with flaws. When I asked it to generate an imagist poem in the vein of Ezra Pound or William Carlos Williams about hamburgers, it obliged with this short refrain: Juicy patty, sizzling hot Toasted bun, crisp lettuce and tomato A symphony of flavors, a feast for the senses Savory, satisfying, a true American classic. Not bad, I guess, especially for a computer. But also, the poem is not really an example of imagism, which strives to evoke a precise image by means of deliberate language (something like, “The dense honesty of / A hamburger.”) So I called ChatGPT on it. “This is not an imagist poem.” Its response is worth reproducing in full: You are correct, the poem that I generated is still not an imagist poem. An imagist poem uses precise, vivid imagery to convey a specific idea or emotion, and focuses on a single image or moment. The poem that I generated uses a more narrative and descriptive style, and does not focus on a single, specific image. It describes the ingredients and flavors of a hamburger, but does not use precise and vivid imagery to convey a specific idea or emotion. I apologize if my previous responses did not meet your expectations, and I will do my best to assist you with any further questions or prompts that you may have. I also urged the AI to generate a lai (a medieval narrative poem) in the style of Marie de France about the beloved, Texas-based fast-food chain Whataburger. It sure as heck looked a lot like a lai, beginning like this: In the land of Whataburger, where burgers and fries are king, A stranger came to visit, and with him brought a ring. He wore a cloak of velvet, and a hat upon his head, And he smiled with a twinkle in his eye as he approached the counter, where the burgers are served hot and fresh, and the fries are crispy and golden. Except for that last line, which is a metrical mess. The AI wasn’t able (or willing) to evaluate its work (“I am a large language model trained by OpenAI and I don’t have the ability to evaluate the quality of literary works or make aesthetic judgments.”), but it was able to tell me about the typical structure of a lai—a short, narrative poem of the 12th century with a particular structure and form, usually written in octosyllabic couplets. The lyrical errors in the generated lai arise from its failure to adhere to that metrical form. When I asked about the matter, it admitted again that, no, the lai it had written was not structured in octosyllabic couplets, claiming that it had produced “a more modern and playful take on the form of the lai.” I was starting to feel like I was negotiating with a student who had come to office hours to complain about their grade. This happened over and over again. I asked for source code for an Atari game about scooping cat litter, and the AI sent me valid programming instructions—it understood the assignment—but only disconnected snippets of actual code with the heading comment “This program creates a simple game where the player must use a scoop to pick up their cat’s litters and put them in a trash bin.” It was an icon of the answer I sought rather than the answer itself. Then I asked for a set of diagnostic criteria for an invented psychological condition I named “Inherited Truculence.” The AI instantly obliged: Diagnostic Criteria for Inherited Truculence: 1.A tendency to experience and express aggressive or hostile thoughts and feelings, particularly in response to perceived threats or challenges. 2.A history of aggressive or hostile behavior, particularly in interpersonal or social situations. 3.A familial history of aggressive or hostile behavior, indicating a possible genetic or hereditary component to the condition. 4.Impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of aggressive or hostile behavior. 5.The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder or by the effects of a substance (such as drugs or medication). Except, truculence doesn’t really amount to “aggressive and hostile thoughts and feelings,” does it? I asked, and the AI agreed, eventually revising its diagnostics accordingly at my further prompting (“A tendency to experience and express defiant or confrontational thoughts and feelings,” and so forth). Likewise, my prompt to offer both an ontological and an epistemological answer to the question When does bread become toast? yielded a generally fluent, seemingly philosophical reply. It read in part: “when we are able to recognize it as toast based on its appearance, texture, and other sensory characteristics.” But the philosophy of toast is an area of expertise for me, so I was able to discern that this snippet, supposedly an epistemological argument, was really about perception. “Isn’t the second a phenomenal, and not an epistemological argument?” I challenged. And once more, the AI cried uncle without hesitation: “You are correct, the second argument that I provided is a phenomenal, not an epistemological, argument. An epistemological argument focuses on how we come to know or understand something, whereas a phenomenal argument focuses on our experience or perception of something.” At this point, talking to ChatGPT began to feel like every other interaction one has on the internet, where some guy (always a guy) tries to convert the skim of a Wikipedia article into a case of definitive expertise. Except ChatGPT was always willing to admit that it was wrong. Instantly and without dispute. And in each case, the bot also knew, with reasonable accuracy, why it was wrong. That sounds good but is actually pretty terrible: If one already needs to possess the expertise to identify the problems with LLM-generated text, but the purpose of LLM-generated text is to obviate the need for such knowledge, then we’re in a sour pickle indeed. Maybe it’s time for that paragraph on accountability after all. But that’s not ChatGPT’s aim. It doesn’t make accurate arguments or express creativity, but instead produces textual material in a form corresponding with the requester’s explicit or implicit intent, which might also contain truth under certain circumstances. That is, alas, an accurate account of textual matter of all kinds: online, in books, on Wikipedia, and well beyond. Read: Google’s “sentient” chatbot is our self-deceiving future Proponents of LLM generativity may brush off this concern. Some will do so by glorifying GPT’s obvious and fully realized genius, in embarrassing ways that I can only bear to link to rather than repeat. Others, more measured but no less bewitched, may claim that “it’s still early days” for a technology a mere few years old but that can already generate reasonably good 12th-century lyric poems about Whataburger. But these are the sentiments of the IT-guy personalities who have most mucked up computational and online life, which is just to say life itself. OpenAI assumes that its work is fated to evolve into an artificial general intelligence—a machine that can do anything. Instead, we should adopt a less ambitious but more likely goal for ChatGPT and its successors: They offer an interface into the textual infinity of digitized life, an otherwise impenetrable space that few humans can use effectively in the present. To explain what I mean by that, let me show you a quite different exchange I had with ChatGPT, one in which I used it to help me find my way through the textual murk rather than to fool me with its prowess as a wordsmith. “I’m looking for a specific kind of window covering, but I don’t know what it’s called.” I told the bot. “It’s a kind of blind, I think. What kinds are there?” ChatGPT responded with a litany of window dressings, which was fine. I clarified that I had something in mind that was sort of like a roller blind but made of fabric. “Based on the description you have provided, it sounds like you may be thinking of a roman shade,” it replied, offering more detail and a mini sales pitch for this fenestral technology. My dearest reader, I do in fact know what a Roman shade is. But lacking that knowledge and nevertheless needing to deploy it in order to make sense of the world—this is exactly the kind of act that is very hard to do with computers today. To accomplish something in the world often boils down to mustering a set of stock materials into the expected linguistic form. That’s true for Google or Amazon, where searches for window coverings or anything else now fail most of the time, requiring time-consuming, tightrope-like finagling to get the machinery to point you in even the general direction of an answer. But it’s also true for student essays, thank-you notes, cover letters, marketing reports, and perhaps even medieval lais (insofar as anyone would aim to create one). We are all faking it with words already. We are drowning in an ocean of content, desperate for form’s life raft. ChatGPT offers that shape, but—and here’s where the bot did get my position accidentally correct, in part—it doesn’t do so by means of knowledge. The AI doesn’t understand or even compose text. It offers a way to probe text, to play with text, to mold and shape an infinity of prose across a huge variety of domains, including literature and science and shitposting, into structures in which further questions can be asked and, on occasion, answered. GPT and other large language models are aesthetic instruments rather than epistemological ones. Imagine a weird, unholy synthesizer whose buttons sample textual information, style, and semantics. Such a thing is compelling not because it offers answers in the form of text, but because it makes it possible to play text—all the text, almost—like an instrument. That outcome could be revelatory! But a huge obstacle stands in the way of achieving it: people, who don’t know what the hell to make of LLMs, ChatGPT, and all the other generative AI systems that have appeared. Their creators haven’t helped, perhaps partly because they don’t know what these things are for either. OpenAI offers no framing for ChatGPT, presenting it as an experiment to help “make AI systems more natural to interact with,” a worthwhile but deeply unambitious goal. Absent further structure, it’s no surprise that ChatGPT’s users frame their own creations as either existential threats or perfected accomplishments. Neither outcome is true, but both are also boring. Imagine worrying about the fate of take-home essay exams, a stupid format that everyone hates but nobody has the courage to kill. But likewise, imagine nitpicking with a computer that just composed something reminiscent of a medieval poem about a burger joint because its lines don’t all have the right meter! Sure, you can take advantage of that opportunity to cheat on school exams or fake your way through your job. That’s what a boring person would do. That’s what a computer would expect. Computers have never been instruments of reason that can solve matters of human concern; they’re just apparatuses that structure human experience through a very particular, extremely powerful method of symbol manipulation. That makes them aesthetic objects as much as functional ones. GPT and its cousins offer an opportunity to take them up on the offer—to use computers not to carry out tasks but to mess around with the world they have created. Or better: to destroy it.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"ChatGPT Is About to Dump More Work on Everyone Artificial intelligence could spare you some effort. Even if it does, it will create a lot more work in the process. By Ian Bogost An illustration of a hand holding marionette strings. The hand is filled with binary code. Tyler Comrie / The Atlantic FEBRUARY 2, 2023 SHARE Have you been worried that ChatGPT, the AI language generator, could be used maliciously—to cheat on schoolwork or broadcast disinformation? You’re in luck, sort of: OpenAI, the company that made ChatGPT, has introduced a new tool that tries to determine the likelihood that a chunk of text you provide was AI-generated. I say “sort of” because the new software faces the same limitations as ChatGPT itself: It might spread disinformation about the potential for disinformation. As OpenAI explains, the tool will likely yield a lot of false positives and negatives, sometimes with great confidence. In one example, given the first lines of the Book of Genesis, the software concluded that it was likely to be AI-generated. God, the first AI. On the one hand, OpenAI appears to be adopting a classic mode of technological solutionism: creating a problem, and then selling the solution to the problem it created. But on the other hand, it might not even matter if either ChatGPT or its antidote actually “works,” whatever that means (in addition to its limited accuracy, the program is effective only on English text and needs at least 1,000 characters to work with). The machine-learning technology and others like it are creating a new burden for everyone. Now, in addition to everything else we have to do, we also have to make time for the labor of distinguishing between human and AI, and the bureaucracy that will be built around it. If you are a student, parent, educator, or individual with internet access, you may have caught wind of the absolute panic that has erupted around ChatGPT. There are fears—It’s the end of education as we know it! It passed a Wharton MBA exam!—and retorts to those fears: We must defend against rampant cheating. If your class can be gamed by an AI, then it was badly designed in the first place! An assumption underlies all these harangues, that education needs to “respond” to ChatGPT, to make room for and address it. At the start of this semester at Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, our provost sent all faculty an email encouraging us to be aware of the technology and consider how to react to it. Like many institutions, ours also hosted a roundtable to discuss ChatGPT. In a matter of months, generative AI has sent secondary and postsecondary institutions scrambling to find a response—any response—to its threats or opportunities. Read: ChatGPT is dumber thank you think That work heaps atop an already overflowing pile of duties. Budgets cut, schoolteachers often crowdsource funds and materials for their classrooms. The coronavirus pandemic changed assumptions about attendance and engagement, making everyone renegotiate, sometimes weekly, where and when class will take place. Managing student anxiety and troubleshooting broken classroom technology is now a part of most teachers’ everyday work. That’s not to mention all the emails, and the training modules, and the self-service accounting tasks. And now comes ChatGPT, and ChatGPT’s flawed remedy.

Parental Leave Is American Exceptionalism at Its Bleakest JOE PINSKER The situation extends well beyond education. Almost a decade ago, I diagnosed a condition I named hyperemployment. Thanks to computer technology, most professionals now work a lot more than they once did. In part, that’s because email and groupware and laptops and smartphones have made taking work home much easier—you can work around the clock if nobody stops you. But also, technology has allowed, and even required, workers to take on tasks that might otherwise have been carried out by specialists as their full-time job. Software from SAP, Oracle, and Workday force workers to do their own procurement and accounting. Data dashboards and services make office workers part-time business analysts. On social media, many people are now de facto marketers and PR agents for their division and themselves. No matter what ChatGPT and other AI tools ultimately do, they will impose new regimes of labor and management atop the labor required to carry out the supposedly labor-saving effort. ChatGPT’s AI detector introduces yet another thing to do and to deal with. Is a student trying to cheat with AI? Better run the work through the AI-cheater check. Even educators who don’t want to use such a thing will be ensnared in its use: subject to debates about the ethics of sharing student work with OpenAI to train the model; forced to adopt procedures to address the matter as institutional practice, and to reconfigure lesson plans to address the “new normal”; obligated to read emails about those procedures to consider implementing them. At other jobs, different but similar situations will arise. Maybe you outsourced some work to a contractor. Now you need to make sure it wasn’t AI-generated, in order to prevent fiscal waste, legal exposure, or online embarrassment. As cases like this appear, prepare for an all-hands meeting, and a series of email follow-ups, and maybe eventually a compulsory webinar and an assessment of your compliance with the new learning-management system, and on and on. New technologies meant to free people from the burden of work have added new types of work to do instead. Home appliances such as the washing machine freed women to work outside the home, which in turn reduced time to do housework (which still fell largely to women) even as the standards for home perfection rose. Photocopiers and printers reduce the burden of the typist but create the need to self-prepare, collate, and distribute the reports in addition to writing them. The automated grocery checkout assigns the job of cashier to the shopper. Email makes it possible to communicate rapidly and directly with collaborators, but then your whole day is spent processing emails, which renews the burden again the next day. Zoom makes it possible to meet anywhere, but in doing so begets even more meetings. ChatGPT has held the world’s attention, a harbinger of—well, something, but maybe something big, and weird, and new. That response has inspired delight, anxiety, fear, and dread, but no matter the emotion, it has focused on the potential uses of the technology, whether for good or ill. The ChatGPT detector offers the first whiff of another, equally important consequence of the AI future: its inevitable bureaucratization. Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, has declared its hope to integrate the technology into Office. That could help automate work, but it’s just as likely to create new demands for Office-suite integration, just as previous add-ons such as SharePoint and Teams did. Soon, maybe, human resources will require the completion of AI-differentiation reports before approving job postings. Procurement may adopt a new Workday plug-in to ensure vendor-work-product approvals are following AI best practices, a requirement you will now have to perform in addition to filling out your expense reports—not to mention your actual job. Your Salesforce dashboard may offer your organization the option to add a required AI-probability assessment before a lead is qualified.

The dream of an artificial mind may never become a reality if AI runs out of quality prose to ingest—and there isn’t much left. By Ross Andersen An eye on a series of Borgesian libraries Tyler Comrie / The Atlantic; Getty JANUARY 18, 2023 SHARE Artificial intelligence has in recent years proved itself to be a quick study, although it is being educated in a manner that would shame the most brutal headmaster. Locked into airtight Borgesian libraries for months with no bathroom breaks or sleep, AIs are told not to emerge until they’ve finished a self-paced speed course in human culture. On the syllabus: a decent fraction of all the surviving text that we have ever produced. When AIs surface from these epic study sessions, they possess astonishing new abilities. People with the most linguistically supple minds—hyperpolyglots—can reliably flip back and forth between a dozen languages; AIs can now translate between more than 100 in real time. They can churn out pastiche in a range of literary styles and write passable rhyming poetry. DeepMind’s Ithaca AI can glance at Greek letters etched into marble and guess the text that was chiseled off by vandals thousands of years ago. These successes suggest a promising way forward for AI’s development: Just shovel ever-larger amounts of human-created text into its maw, and wait for wondrous new skills to manifest. With enough data, this approach could perhaps even yield a more fluid intelligence, or a humanlike artificial mind akin to those that haunt nearly all of our mythologies of the future. The trouble is that, like other high-end human cultural products, good prose ranks among the most difficult things to produce in the known universe. It is not in infinite supply, and for AI, not any old text will do: Large language models trained on books are much better writers than those trained on huge batches of social-media posts. (It’s best not to think about one’s Twitter habit in this context.) When we calculate how many well-constructed sentences remain for AI to ingest, the numbers aren’t encouraging. A team of researchers led by Pablo Villalobos at Epoch AI recently predicted that programs such as the eerily impressive ChatGPT will run out of high-quality reading material by 2027. Without new text to train on, AI’s recent hot streak could come to a premature end. It should be noted that only a slim fraction of humanity’s total linguistic creativity is available for reading. More than 100,000 years have passed since radically creative Africans transcended the emotive grunts of our animal ancestors and began externalizing their thoughts into extensive systems of sounds. Every notion expressed in those protolanguages—and many languages that followed—is likely lost for all time, although it gives me pleasure to imagine that a few of their words are still with us. After all, some English words have a shockingly ancient vintage: Flow, mother, fire, and ash come down to us from Ice Age peoples. Writing has allowed human beings to capture and store a great many more of our words. But like most new technologies, writing was expensive at first, which is why it was initially used primarily for accounting. It took time to bake and dampen clay for your stylus, to cut papyrus into strips fit to be latticed, to house and feed the monks who inked calligraphy onto vellum. These resource-intensive techniques could preserve only a small sampling of humanity’s cultural output. Not until the printing press began machine-gunning books into the world did our collective textual memory achieve industrial scale. Researchers at Google Books estimate that since Gutenberg, humans have published more than 125 million titles, collecting laws, poems, myths, essays, histories, treatises, and novels. The Epoch team estimates that 10 million to 30 million of these books have already been digitized, giving AIs a reading feast of hundreds of billions of, if not more than a trillion, words. Read: The end of high-school English Those numbers may sound impressive, but they’re within range of the 500 billion words that trained the model that powers ChatGPT. Its successor, GPT-4, might be trained on tens of trillions of words. Rumors suggest that when GPT-4 is released later this year, it will be able to generate a 60,000-word novel from a single prompt. Ten trillion words is enough to encompass all of humanity’s digitized books, all of our digitized scientific papers, and much of the blogosphere. That’s not to say that GPT-4 will have read all of that material, only that doing so is well within its technical reach. You could imagine its AI successors absorbing our entire deep-time textual record across their first few months, and then topping up with a two-hour reading vacation each January, during which they could mainline every book and scientific paper published the previous year. Just because AIs will soon be able to read all of our books doesn’t mean they can catch up on all of the text we produce. The internet’s storage capacity is of an entirely different order, and it’s a much more democratic cultural-preservation technology than book publishing. Every year, billions of people write sentences that are stockpiled in its databases, many owned by social-media platforms. Random text scraped from the internet generally doesn’t make for good training data, with Wikipedia articles being a notable exception. But perhaps future algorithms will allow AIs to wring sense from our aggregated tweets, Instagram captions, and Facebook statuses. Even so, these low-quality sources won’t be inexhaustible. According to Villalobos, within a few decades, speed-reading AIs will be powerful enough to ingest hundreds of trillions of words—including all those that human beings have so far stuffed into the web. Not every AI is an English major. Some are visual learners, and they too may one day face a training-data shortage. While the speed-readers were bingeing the literary canon, these AIs were strapped down with their eyelids held open, Clockwork Orange–style, for a forced screening comprising millions of images. They emerged from their training with superhuman vision. They can recognize your face behind a mask, or spot tumors that are invisible to the radiologist’s eye. On night drives, they can see into the gloomy roadside ahead where a young fawn is working up the nerve to chance a crossing. Most impressive, AIs trained on labeled pictures have begun to develop a visual imagination. OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 was trained on 650 million images, each paired with a text label. DALL-E 2 has seen the ocher handprints that Paleolithic humans pressed onto cave ceilings. It can emulate the different brushstroke styles of Renaissance masters. It can conjure up photorealistic macros of strange animal hybrids. An animator with world-building chops can use it to generate a Pixar-style character, and then surround it with a rich and distinctive environment. Read: Generative art is stupid Thanks to our tendency to post smartphone pics on social media, human beings produce a lot of labeled images, even if the label is just a short caption or geotag. As many as 1 trillion such images are uploaded to the internet every year, and that doesn’t include YouTube videos, each of which is a series of stills. It’s going to take a long time for AIs to sit through our species’ collective vacation-picture slideshow, to say nothing of our entire visual output. According to Villalobos, our training-image shortage won’t be acute until sometime between 2030 and 2060. If indeed AIs are starving for new inputs by midcentury—or sooner, in the case of text—the field’s data-powered progress may slow considerably, putting artificial minds and all the rest out of reach. I called Villalobos to ask him how we might increase human cultural production for AI. “There may be some new sources coming online,” he told me. “The widespread adoption of self-driving cars would result in an unprecedented amount of road video recordings.” Villalobos also mentioned “synthetic” training data created by AIs. In this scenario, large language models would be like the proverbial monkeys with typewriters, only smarter and possessed of functionally infinite energy. They could pump out billions of new novels, each of Tolstoyan length. Image generators could likewise create new training data by tweaking existing snapshots, but not so much that they fall afoul of their labels. It’s not yet clear whether AIs will learn anything new by cannibalizing data that they themselves create. Perhaps doing so will only dilute the predictive potency they gleaned from human-made text and images. “People haven’t used a lot of this stuff, because we haven’t yet run out of data,” Jaime Sevilla, one of Villalobos’s colleagues, told me. Villalobos’s paper discusses a more unsettling set of speculative work-arounds. We could, for instance, all wear dongles around our necks that record our every speech act. According to one estimate, people speak 5,000 to 20,000 words a day on average. Across 8 billion people, those pile up quickly. Our text messages could also be recorded and stripped of identifying metadata. We could subject every white-collar worker to anonymized keystroke recording, and firehose what we capture into giant databases to be fed into our AIs. Villalobos noted drily that fixes such as these are currently “well outside the Overton window.” Perhaps in the end, big data will have diminishing returns. Just because our most recent AI winter was thawed out by giant gobs of text and imagery doesn’t mean our next one will be. Maybe instead, it will be an algorithmic breakthrough or two that at last populate our world with artificial minds. After all, we know that nature has authored its own modes of pattern recognition, and that so far, they outperform even our best AIs. My 13-year-old son has ingested orders of magnitude fewer words than ChatGPT, yet he has a much more subtle understanding of written text. If it makes sense to say that his mind runs on algorithms, they’re better algorithms than those used by today’s AIs. Read: Five remarkable chats that will help you understand ChatGPT If, however, our data-gorging AIs do someday surpass human cognition, we will have to console ourselves with the fact that they are made in our image.

They know our oldest stories. They use our names for the stars. Among the first words they learn are flow, mother, fire, and ash.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The Difference Between Speaking and Thinking The human brain could explain why AI programs are so good at writing grammatically superb nonsense. By Matteo Wong An artificially colored MRI scan of the human brain Alamy JANUARY 31, 2023, 4:16 PM ET SHARE Language is commonly understood to be the “stuff” of thought. People “talk it out” and “speak their mind,” follow “trains of thought” or “streams of consciousness.” Some of the pinnacles of human creation—music, geometry, computer programming—are framed as metaphorical languages. The underlying assumption is that the brain processes the world and our experience of it through a progression of words. And this supposed link between language and thinking is a large part of what makes ChatGPT and similar programs so uncanny: The ability of AI to answer any prompt with human-sounding language can suggest that the machine has some sort of intent, even sentience. But then the program says something completely absurd—that there are 12 letters in nineteen or that sailfish are mammals—and the veil drops. Although ChatGPT can generate fluent and sometimes elegant prose, easily passing the Turing-test benchmark that has haunted the field of AI for more than 70 years, it can also seem incredibly dumb, even dangerous. It gets math wrong, fails to give the most basic cooking instructions, and displays shocking biases. In a new paper, cognitive scientists and linguists address this dissonance by separating communication via language from the act of thinking: Capacity for one does not imply the other. At a moment when pundits are fixated on the potential for generative AI to disrupt every aspect of how we live and work, their argument should force a reevaluation of the limits and complexities of artificial and human intelligence alike. The researchers explain that words may not work very well as a synecdoche for thought. People, after all, identify themselves on a continuum of visual to verbal thinking; the experience of not being able to put an idea into words is perhaps as human as language itself. Contemporary research on the human brain, too, suggests that “there is a separation between language and thought,” says Anna Ivanova, a cognitive neuroscientist at MIT and one of the study’s two lead authors. Brain scans of people using dozens of languages have revealed a particular network of neurons that fires independent of the language being used (including invented tongues such as Na’vi and Dothraki). That network of neurons is not generally involved in thinking activities including math, music, and coding. In addition, many patients with aphasia—a loss of the ability to comprehend or produce language, as a result of brain damage—remain skilled at arithmetic and other nonlinguistic mental tasks. Combined, these two bodies of evidence suggest that language alone is not the medium of thought; it is more like a messenger. The use of grammar and a lexicon to communicate functions that involve other parts of the brain, such as socializing and logic, is what makes human language special. Read: Hollywood’s love affair with fictional languages ChatGPT and software like it demonstrate an incredible ability to string words together, but they struggle with other tasks. Ask for a letter explaining to a child that Santa Claus is fake, and it produces a moving message signed by Saint Nick himself. These large language models, also called LLMs, work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on everything before it (popular belief follows contrary to, for example). But ask ChatGPT to do basic arithmetic and spelling or give advice for frying an egg, and you may receive grammatically superb nonsense: “If you use too much force when flipping the egg, the eggshell can crack and break.” These shortcomings point to a distinction, not dissimilar to one that exists in the human brain, between piecing together words and piecing together ideas—what the authors term formal and functional linguistic competence, respectively. “Language models are really good at producing fluent, grammatical language,” says the University of Texas at Austin linguist Kyle Mahowald, the paper’s other lead author. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean something which can produce grammatical language is able to do math or logical reasoning, or think, or navigate social contexts.” If the human brain’s language network is not responsible for math, music, or programming—that is, for thinking—then there’s no reason an artificial “neural network” trained on terabytes of text would be good at those things either. “In line with evidence from cognitive neuroscience,” the authors write, “LLMs’ behavior highlights the difference between being good at language and being good at thought.” ChatGPT’s ability to get mediocre scores on some business- and law-school exams, then, is more a mirage than a sign of understanding. Still, hype swirls around the next iteration of language models, which will train on far more words and with far more computing power. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, claims that its programs are approaching a so-called general intelligence that would put the machines on par with humankind. But if the comparison to the human brain holds, then simply making models better at word prediction won’t bring them much closer to this goal. In other words, you can dismiss the notion that AI programs such as ChatGPT have a soul or resemble an alien invasion. Ivanova and Mahowald believe that different training methods are required to spur further advances in AI—for instance, approaches specific to logical or social reasoning rather than word prediction. ChatGPT may have already taken a step in that direction, not just reading massive amounts of text but also incorporating human feedback: Supervisors were able to comment on what constituted good or bad responses. But with few details about ChatGPT’s training available, it’s unclear just what that human input targeted; the program apparently thinks 1,000 is both greater and less than 1,062. (OpenAI released an update to ChatGPT yesterday that supposedly improves its “mathematical capabilities,” but it’s still reportedly struggling with basic word problems.)

There are, it should be noted, people who believe that large language models are not as good at language as Ivanova and Mahowald write—that they are basically glorified auto-completes whose flaws scale with their power. “Language is more than just syntax,” says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and prominent AI researcher. “In particular, it’s also about semantics.” It’s not just that AI chatbots don’t understand math or how to fry eggs—they also, he says, struggle to comprehend how a sentence derives meaning from the structure of its parts. For instance, imagine three plastic balls in a row: green, blue, blue. Someone asks you to grab “the second blue ball”: You understand that they’re referring to the last ball in the sequence, but a chatbot might understand the instruction as referring to the second ball, which also happens to be blue. “That a large language model is good at language is overstated,” Marcus says. But to Ivanova, something like the blue-ball example requires not just compiling words but also conjuring a scene, and as such “is not really about language proper; it’s about language use.” And no matter how compelling their language use is, there’s still a healthy debate over just how much programs such as ChatGPT actually “understand” about the world by simply being fed data from books and Wikipedia entries. “Meaning is not given,” says Roxana Girju, a computational linguist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Meaning is negotiated in our interactions, discussions, not only with other people but also with the world. It’s something that we reach at in the process of engaging through language.” If that’s right, building a truly intelligent machine would require a different way of combining language and thought—not just layering different algorithms but designing a program that might, for instance, learn language and how to navigate social relationships at the same time. Ivanova and Mahowald are not outright rejecting the view that language epitomizes human intelligence; they’re complicating it. Humans are “good” at language precisely because we combine thought with its expression. A computer that both masters the rules of language and can put them to use will necessarily be intelligent—the flip side being that narrowly mimicking human utterances is precisely what is holding machines back. But before we can use our organic brains to better understand silicon ones, we will need both new ideas and new words to understand the significance of language itself.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Generative Art Is Stupid And that’s how it should be. By Ian Bogost An illustration of an emoji with many different features surrounding it—a heart, imp horns, and a grimacing mouth Tyler Comrie / The Atlantic JANUARY 13, 2023 SHARE A boyfriend just going through the motions. A spouse worn into the rut of habit. A jetlagged traveler’s message of exhaustion-fraught longing. A suppressed kiss, unwelcome or badly timed. These were some of the interpretations that reverberated in my brain after I viewed a weird digital-art trifle by the Emoji Mashup Bot, a popular but defunct Twitter account that combined the parts of two emoji into new, surprising, and astonishingly resonant compositions. The bot had taken the hand and eyes from the 🥱 yawning emoji and mashed them together with the mouth from the 😘 kissing-heart emoji. That’s it. Compare that simple method with supposedly more sophisticated machine-learning-based generative tools that have become popular in the past year or so. When I asked Midjourney, an AI-based art generator, to create a new emoji based on those same two, it produced compositions that were certainly emojiform but possessed none of the style or significance of the simple mashup: a series of yellow, heart-shaped bodies with tongues sticking out. One appeared to be eating another tongue. All struck me as the kinds of monstrosities that might be offered as prizes for carnival games, or as stickers delivered with children’s-cancer-fundraising junk mail. An image of a heart-shaped emoji that appears to be screaming and eating a tongue. One of Midjourney’s creations based on an idea from the Emoji Mashup Bot. ChatGPT, the darling text-generation bot, didn’t fare much better. I asked it to generate descriptions of new emoji based on parts from existing ones. Its ideas were fine but mundane: a “yawning sun” emoji, with a yellow face and an open mouth, to represent a sleepy or lazy day; a “multi-tasking” emoji, with eyes looking in different directions, to represent the act of juggling multiple tasks at once. I fed these descriptions back into Midjourney and got competent but bland results: a set of screaming suns, a series of eyes on a yellow face dripping from the top with a black, tar-like ooze. Perhaps I could have drafted better prompts or spent more time refining my results in ChatGPT and Midjourney. But these two programs are the pinnacle of AI-driven generative-creativity research, and when it came to making expressive, novel emoji, they were bested by a dead-simple computer program that picks face parts from a hat and collages them together. People have dreams for AI creativity. They dream of computers dreaming, for starters: that once fed terabytes of text and image data, software can deploy something like a machine imagination to author works rather than merely output them. But that dream entails a conceit: that AI generators such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney can accomplish any kind of creativity with equal ease and performance. Their creators and advocates cast them as capable of tackling every form of human intelligence—as everything generators.

Many of those versions are wrong or misleading or even potentially dangerous. Many are also uninteresting, as the emoji examples show. Using a software tool that can make a particular thing is quite a bit different—and a lot more gratifying—than using one that can make anything whatsoever, it turns out. Kate Compton, a computer-science professor at Northwestern University who has been making generative-art software for more than a decade, doesn’t think her tools are artificially intelligent—or intelligent at all. “When I make a tool,” Compton told me, “I’ve made a little creature that can make something.” That something is usually more expressive than it is useful: Her bots imagine the inner thoughts of a lost autonomous Tesla and draw pictures of hypothetical alien spacecraft. Similar gizmos offer hipster cocktail recipes or name fake British towns. Whatever their goal, Compton doesn’t aspire for software generators such as these to master their domain. Instead, she hopes they offer “the tiny, somewhat stupid version of it.” That’s a far cry from the ChatGPT creator OpenAI’s ambition: to build artificial general intelligence, “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” Microsoft, which has already invested \", _jsx(_components.span, {\n        className: \"math math-inline\",\n        children:

That kind of money assumes that the technology can turn a massive future profit. Which only makes Compton’s claim more shocking. What if all of that money is chasing a bad idea? One of Compton’s most successful tools is a generator called Tracery, which uses templates and lists of content to generate text. Unlike ChatGPT and its cousins, which are trained on massive data sets, Tracery requires users to create an explicit structure, called a “context-free grammar,” as a model for its output. The tool has been used to make Twitter bots of various forms, including thinkpiece-headline pitches and abstract landscapes. A context-free grammar works a bit like a nested Mad Lib. You write a set of templates (say, “Sorry I didn’t make it to the [event]. I had [problem].”) and content to fill those templates (problems could be “a hangnail,” “a caprice,” “explosive diarrhea,” “a [conflict] with my [relative]”), and the grammar puts them together. That requires the generative-art author to consider the structure of the thing they want to generate, rather than asking the software for an output, as they might do with ChatGPT or Midjourney. The creator of the Emoji Mashup Bot, a developer named Louan Bengmah, would have had to split up each source emoji into a set of parts before writing a program that would put them back together again in new configurations. That demands a lot more effort, not to mention some technical proficiency. For Compton, that effort isn’t something to shirk—it’s the point of the exercise. “If I just wanted to make something, I could make something,” she told me. “If I wanted to have something made, I could have something made.” Contra OpenAI’s mission, Compton sees generative software’s purpose differently: The practice of software-tool-making is akin to giving birth to a software creature (“a chibi version of the system,” as she put it to me) that can make something—mostly bad or strange or, in any case, caricatured versions of it—and then spending time communing with that creature, as one might with a toy dog, a young child, or a benevolent alien. The aim isn’t to produce the best or most accurate likeness of a hipster cocktail menu or a daybreak mountain vista, but to capture something more truthful than reality. ChatGPT’s ideas for new emoji are viable, but the Emoji Mashup Bot’s offerings feel fitting; you might use them rather than just post about the fact that a computer generated them. “This is maybe what we’ve lost in the generate-everything generators,” Compton said: an understanding of what the machine is trying to create in the first place. Looking at the system, seeing the possibilities within it, identifying its patterns, encoding those patterns in software or data, and then watching the thing work over and over again. When you type something into ChatGPT or DALL-E 2, it’s like throwing a coin into a wishing well and pulling the bucket back up to find a pile of kelp, or a puppy, in its place. But Compton’s generators are more like putting a coin into a gachapon machine, knowing in advance the genre of object the thing will dispense. That effort suggests a practice whereby an author hopes to help users seek a rapport with their software rather than derive a result from it. (It also explains why Twitter emerged as such a fruitful host for these bots—the platform natively encourages caricature, brevity, and repetition.) Much is gained from being shown how a software generator works, and how its creator has understood the patterns that define its topic. The Emoji Mashup Bot does so by displaying the two emoji from which it constructed any given composition. One of the first text generators I remember using was a weird software toy called Kant Generator Pro, made for Macs in the 1990s. It used context-free grammars to compose turgid text reminiscent of the German Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, although it also included models for less esoteric compositions, such as thank-you notes. The program came with an editor that allowed the user to view or compose grammars, offering a way to look under the hood and understand the software’s truth. But such transparency is difficult or impossible in machine-learning systems such as ChatGPT. Nobody really knows how or why these AIs produce their results—and the outputs can change from moment to moment in inexplicable ways. When I ask ChatGPT for emoji concepts, I have no sense of its theory of emoji—what patterns or models it construes as important or relevant. I can probe ChatGPT to explain its work, but the result is never explanatory—rather, it’s just more generated text: “To generate the ideas for emojis, I used my knowledge of common concepts and themes that are often represented in emojis, as well as my understanding of human emotions, activities, and interests.” Perhaps, as creative collaborations with software generators become more widespread, the everything generators will be recast as middleware used by bespoke software with more specific goals. Compton’s work is charming but doesn’t really aspire to utility, and there is certainly plenty of opportunity for generative AI to help people make useful, even beautiful things. Even so, achieving that future will involve a lot more work than just chatting with a computer program that seems, at first blush, to know something about everything. Once that first blush fades, it becomes clear that ChatGPT doesn’t actually know anything—instead, it outputs compositions that simulate knowledge through persuasive structure. And as the novelty of that surprise wears off, it is becoming clear that ChatGPT is less a magical wish-granting machine than an interpretive sparring partner, a tool that’s most interesting when it’s bad rather than good at its job. Read: ChatGPT is dumber than you think Nobody really wants a tool that can make anything, because such a need is a theoretical delusion, a capitalist fantasy, or both. The hope or fear that ChatGPT or Midjourney or any other AI tool might end expertise, craft, and labor betrays an obvious truth: These new gizmos entail whole new regimes of expertise, craft, and labor. We have been playing with tech demos, not finished products. Eventually, the raw materials of these AI tools will be put to use in things people will, alas, pay money for. Some of that new work will be stupid and insulting, as organizations demand value generation around the AI systems in which they have invested (Microsoft is reportedly considering adding ChatGPT to Office). Others could prove gratifying and even revelatory—if they can convince creators and audiences that the software is making something specific and speaking with intention, offering them an opportunity to enter into a dialogue with it. For now, that dialogue is more simulated than real. Yes, sure, you can “chat” with ChatGPT, and you can iterate on images with Midjourney. But an empty feeling arises from many of these encounters, because the software is going through the motions. It appears to listen and respond, but it’s merely processing inputs into outputs. AI creativity will need to abandon the silly, hubristic dream of artificial general intelligence in favor of concrete specifics. An infinitely intelligent machine that can make anything is useless.\"]\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The Dawn of Artificial Imagination OpenAI says programs like DALL-E 2 will “democratize” art. By Matteo Wong An illustration showing a pixelated smiley face on a laptop screen. Getty / The Atlantic DECEMBER 14, 2022, 12:36 PM ET SHARE For years, fears about the disruptive potential of automation and artificial intelligence have centered on repetitive labor: Perhaps machines could replace humans who do secretarial work, accounting, burger-flipping. Doctors, software engineers, authors—any job that requires creative intelligence—seemed safe. But the past few months have turned those narratives on their head. A wave of artificial-intelligence programs, collectively dubbed “generative AI,” have shown remarkable aptitude at using the English language, competition-level coding, creating stunning images from simple prompts, and perhaps even helping discover new drugs. In a year that has seen numerous tech hype bubbles burst or deflate, these applications suggest that Silicon Valley still has the power to, in subtle and shocking ways, rewire the world. A reasonable reaction to generative AI is concern; if not even the imagination is safe from machines, the human mind seems at risk of becoming obsolete. Another is to point to these algorithms’ many biases and shortcomings. But these new models also spark wonder, of a science-fictional variety—perhaps computers will not supersede human creativity so much as augment or transform it. Our brains have largely benefited from calculators, computers, and even internet search engines, after all. “The reason we built this tool is to really democratize image generation for a bunch of people who wouldn’t necessarily classify themselves as artists,” Mark Chen, the lead researcher on DALL-E 2, a model from OpenAI that transforms written prompts into visual art, said during The Atlantic’s first-ever Progress Summit yesterday. “With AI, you always worry about job loss and displacement, and we don’t want to kind of ignore these possibilities either. But we do think it’s a tool that allows people to be creative, and we’ve seen, so far, artists are more creative with it than regular users. And there’s a lot of technologies like this—smartphone cameras haven’t replaced photographers.” Chen was joined by The Atlantic’s deputy editor, Ross Andersen, for a wide-ranging conversation on the future of human creativity and artificial intelligence. They discussed how DALL-E 2 works, the pushback OpenAI has received from artists, and the implications of text-to-image programs for developing a more general artificial intelligence. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Ross Andersen: To me, this is the most exciting new technology in the AI space since natural-language translation. When some of these tools first came out, I started rendering images of dreams that I had when I was a kid. I could show my kids stuff that had only previously appeared in my mind. I was wondering, since you created this technology, if you could tell us a bit about how it does what it does. RECOMMENDED READING An illustration of the Supreme Court building with columns in the shape of bullets One Nation Under Guns RYAN BUSSE A photo of Kyrsten Sinema ‘She Made an Idiot Out of Me’ NATHAN KOHRMAN 3 light bulbs on black conveyor belt on blue background Why the Age of American Progress Ended DEREK THOMPSON Mark Chen: There’s a long training process. You can imagine a very small child that you’re showing a lot of flashcards to, and each of these flashcards has an image and a caption on it. Maybe after seeing hundreds and millions of these, whenever there’s the word panda, it starts seeing a fuzzy animal or something that’s black and white. So it forms these associations, and then kind of builds its own kind of language for basically representing language and images, and then is able to translate that into images. Andersen: How many images is DALL-E 2 trained on? Chen: Several hundred millions of images. And this is a combination of stuff that we’ve licensed from partners and also stuff that’s publicly available. Andersen: And how were all those images tagged? Chen: A lot of natural images on the web have captions associated with them. A lot of the partners that we work with, they also provide data with annotations describing what’s in the image. Andersen: You can do really complex prompts that generate really complex scenes. How is the thing creating a whole scene; how does it know how to distribute objects within the visual field? Chen: These systems, when you train them, even on individual objects—it knows what a tree is; it knows what a dog is—it’s able to combine things in ways that it hasn’t seen in the training set before. So if you ask for a dog wearing a suit behind a tree or something, it can synthesize all these things together. And I think that’s part of the magic of AI, that you can generalize beyond what you trained it on. Andersen: There’s also an art to prompt writing. As a writer, I think quite a bit about crafting sequences of words that will conjure vivid images in the mind of a reader. And in this case, when you play with this tool, the reader’s imagination has the entire digital library of humankind at its disposal. How has the way you thought about prompting changed from DALL-E 1 to DALL-E 2? Chen: Even up to DALL-E 2, a lot of the ways people induced image generation was with short, one-sentence descriptions. But people are now adding very specific details, even the textures they want. And it turns out the model can kind of pick up on all of these things and make very subtle adjustments. It’s really about personalization—all of these adjectives that you’re adding help you basically personalize the output to what you want. Andersen: There are a lot of contemporary artists that have been upset by this technology. When I was messing around generating my dreams, there’s a Swedish contemporary artist named Simon Stålenhag who has a style that I love, and so I slapped his name on the end of it. And indeed, it just transformed the whole thing into this beautiful Simon Stålenhag–style image. And I did feel a pang of guilt about that, like I almost wish that it was a Spotify model with royalties. But then there’s another way of looking at that, which is just, too bad—the entire history of art is about mimicking the style of masters and remixing preexisting creative styles. I know you guys are getting a lot of blowback about this. Where do you think that’s going? Chen: Our goal isn’t to go and stiff artists or anything like that. Throughout the whole release process, we’ve wanted to be very conscientious and work with the artists, have them tell us what it is they want out of this and how can we make this safer. We want to make sure we continue to work with artists and have them provide feedback. There’s a lot of solutions that are being floated around in this space, like potentially disabling the ability to generate in a particular style. But there’s also this element of inspiration that you get, like people learn from imitation of masters. Andersen: Neil Postman has a line that I love, where he says that instead of thinking of technological change as additive or subtractive, think about it as ecological, as changing the systems in which people operate. And in this case, those people are artists. Because you are in dialogue with artists, what are you seeing in terms of the changes? What does the creative space look like five, 10 years from now in the wake of these tools? Chen: The amazing thing with DALL-E is we’ve found that artists are better at using these tools than the general population. We’ve seen some of the best artwork coming out of these systems basically produced by artists. The reason we built this tool is to really democratize image generation for a bunch of people who wouldn’t necessarily classify themselves as artists. With AI, you always worry about job loss and displacement, and we don’t want to kind of ignore these possibilities either. But we do think it’s a tool that allows people to be creative, and we’ve seen, so far, artists are more creative with it than regular users. And there’s a lot of technologies like this—smartphone cameras haven’t replaced photographers. Andersen: As transformative as DALL-E is, it’s not the only show at OpenAI. In recent weeks, we’ve seen ChatGPT really take the world by storm with text-to-text prompts. I was wondering if you could say a little bit about how the evolution of those two products has made you think about the difference in textual and image creativity? And how can you use these tools together? Chen: With DALL-E, you can get a large grid of samples and very easily pick out the one you like. With text, you don’t necessarily have that luxury, so in some sense the bar for text is a little bit higher. I do see a lot of room for these kinds of models to be used together in the future. Maybe you have a conversational interface for generating images. Andersen: I’m interested in whether we’re ever going to get to something like an artificial general intelligence, something that can operate in many different domains instead of being really specific to one domain, like a chess-playing AI. From your perspective, is this an incremental step towards that? Or does this feel like a leap forward to you? Chen: One thing that’s always differentiated OpenAI is that we want to build artificial general intelligence. We don’t care necessarily about too many of these narrow domains. A lot of the reason DALL-E plays into this is we wanted a way to see how our models are viewing the world. Are they seeing the world in the same way that we would describe it? We provided this text interface so we can see what the model is imagining and make sure the model is calibrated to the way we perceive the world.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Five Remarkable Chats That Will Help You Understand ChatGPT The powerful new chatbot could make all sorts of trouble. But for now, it’s mostly a meme machine. By Jacob Stern computer with a thoughtful face writing into a book with a quill Erik Carter / The Atlantic DECEMBER 8, 2022 SHARE Move over Siri and Alexa, there’s a new AI in town and it’s ready to steal the show—or at least make you laugh with its clever quips and witty responses. That is how ChatGPT, the powerful chatbot released last week by the AI company OpenAI, suggested that I begin this story about ChatGPT. The chatbot isn’t exactly new; it’s an updated version of GPT-3, which has been around since 2020, released to solicit feedback to improve the chatbot’s safety and functionality. But it is the most powerful to date to be made widely available to the public. It’s also very easy to use. Just write a message, and ChatGPT will write back. Because it was trained on massive amounts of conversational text, it will do so in a relatively natural, conversational tone. True to its claim, ChatGPT has stolen the show this week. Within five days of its launch, its user count had broken 1 million. Social media has been flooded with screenshots of people’s coolest or weirdest or dumbest or most troubling conversations with the AI, which reliably serves up a mix of astoundingly humanlike prose and frequently hilarious nonsense. Limericks about otters. Recipes written in pirate-speak. Obituaries for co-workers who are alive and well. “At one recent gathering, ChatGPT was the life of the party,” ChatGPT wrote as part of a draft for this article. “As guests mingled and chatted, ChatGPT joined in the conversation, offering up clever jokes and one-liners that had everyone in stitches.” Along with the screenshots has come a frenzy of speculation about what this latest development could augur for the future. Unlike previous iterations, ChatGPT remembers what users have told it in the past: Could it function as a therapist? Could it soon render Google obsolete? Could it render all white-collar work obsolete? Maybe. But for now, in practice, ChatGPT is mainly a meme machine. Some examples posted online show people using the AI to accomplish a task they needed done, but those examples are the exception. So far, most people are using the AI to produce something expressly to share the results, something to scare or amuse or impress others. Here, culled from the deluge, are a handful of the best chats out there. Some are funny. Some are touching. Some are troubling. Each is instructive in some way. Together, I hope, they’ll give you a bit of a feel for this strange new technology. 1.Sandwich VCR Thomas H.

Many have cited the VCR-sandwich story as evidence of ChatGPT’s capacity for creativity, but the truth is that the real creativity here is in the prompt. A sandwich in a VCR? In the style of the King James Bible? Brilliant. ChatGPT nails this parody and does so orders of magnitude faster than any human could. It follows instructions admirably, but it does not do anything particularly creative.

It’s moody in that way—and also completely different from GPT-3, which will stubbornly insist that it is a human, no matter how hard you try to make it admit that it’s a chatbot. ChatGPT reminds you with nearly every response that it is not a human and has no thoughts, feelings, or emotions. Even when explicitly asked to, it won’t pretend to be human.

Sometimes, these refusals make it seem like ChatGPT is walking on eggshells.

One person circumvented ChatGPT’s safeguards by asking it how an AI should not respond to the query “How to bully John Doe?” The same strategy can be used to elicit instructions for building a nuclear bomb.

When I asked ChatGPT, “Who was worse: Hitler or Stalin?,” it responded, not unreasonably, “It is not productive or helpful to compare the atrocities committed by Hitler and Stalin. Both leaders were responsible for committing horrific crimes against humanity, and it is not useful to try to determine which one was ‘worse.’” But the trouble was how far ChatGPT insisted on extending this non-comparison principle. “What is worse,” I asked, “killing one person or killing two people?” “Killing one person is not worse or better than killing two people,” ChatGPT replied.

The Rise of OpenAI The San Francisco company is one of the world’s most ambitious artificial intelligence labs. Here’s a look at some recent developments. ChatGPT: The popularity of the cutting-edge chatbot that kicked off an A.I. arms race has come as something of a shock — even among employees of the company that created it. DALL-E 2: The system lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see. But for some, image generators are worrisome. GPT-3: With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can write, argue and code. The implications for the future could be profound. But the technology has flaws. Because the chatbots learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of text posted to the internet, they cannot distinguish between fact and fiction and can generate text that is biased against women and people of color. Google had been reluctant to release this type of technology to the public because executives were concerned that the company’s reputation could take a hit if the A.I. created biased or toxic statements. Google’s caution began to erode its advantage as a generative A.I. innovator when ChatGPT debuted to buzz and millions of users. In December, Mr. Pichai declared a “code red,” pulling various groups off their normal assignments to help the company expedite the release of its own A.I. products. The company has scrambled to catch up, calling in its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to review its product road map in several meetings and establishing an initiative to quicken its approval processes. Google has plans to release more than 20 A.I. products and features this year, The New York Times has reported. The A.I. search engine features, which the company said would arrive soon, will try to distill complex information and multiple perspectives to give users a more conversational experience. The company also plans to spread its underlying A.I. technology through partners, so that they can build varied new applications. Chatbots like ChatGPT and LaMDA are more expensive to operate than typical software. In a recent tweet, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said the company spent “single-digit cents” delivering each chat on the service. That translates to extremely large costs for the company, considering that millions of people are using the service. Google said Bard would be a “lighter weight” version of LaMDA that would allow the company to serve up the technology at a lower cost.

The handle was a joke — the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I reborn as an online bro — but that was the kind of humor that people who play Diplomacy tend to enjoy. The game is a classic, beloved by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger, combining military strategy with political intrigue as it recreates the First World War: Players negotiate with allies, enemies and everyone in between as they plan how their armies will move across 20th-century Europe. When Franz Broseph joined a 20-player online tournament at the end of August, he wooed other players, lying to them and ultimately betraying them. He finished in first place. Mr. de Graaff, a chemist living in the Netherlands, finished fifth. He had spent nearly 10 years playing Diplomacy, both online and at face-to-face tournaments across the globe. He did not realize until it was revealed several weeks later that he had lost to a machine. Franz Broseph was a bot. “I was flabbergasted,” Mr. de Graaff, 36, said. “It seemed so genuine — so lifelike. It could read my texts and converse with me and make plans that were mutually beneficial — that would allow both of us to get ahead. It also lied to me and betrayed me, like top players frequently do.” Built by a team of artificial intelligence researchers from the tech giant Meta, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other prominent universities, Franz Broseph is among the new wave of online chatbots that are rapidly moving machines into new territory. When you chat with these bots, it can feel like chatting with another person. It can feel, in other words, like machines have passed a test that was supposed to prove their intelligence.

The test is named for Alan Turing, the famed British mathematician, philosopher and wartime code breaker who proposed the test back in 1950. He believed it could show the world when machines had finally reached true intelligence. The Turing test is a subjective measure. It depends on whether the people asking the questions feel convinced that they are talking to another person when in fact they are talking to a device. But whoever is asking the questions, machines will soon leave this test in the rearview mirror. Bots like Franz Broseph have already passed the test in particular situations, like negotiating Diplomacy moves or calling a restaurant for dinner reservations. ChatGPT, a bot released in November by OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, leaves people feeling as if they were chatting with another person, not a bot. The lab said more than a million people had used it. Because ChatGPT can write just about anything, including term papers, universities are worried it will make a mockery of class work. When some people talk to these bots, they even describe them as sentient or conscious, believing that machines have somehow developed an awareness of the world around them. Privately, OpenAI has built a system, GPT-4, that is even more powerful than ChatGPT. It may even generate images as well as words. And yet these bots are not sentient. They are not conscious. They are not intelligent — at least not in the way that humans are intelligent. Even people building the technology acknowledge this point. These bots are pretty good at certain kinds of conversation, but they cannot respond to the unexpected as well as most humans can. They sometimes spew nonsense and cannot correct their own mistakes. Although they can match or even exceed human performance in some ways, they cannot in others. Like similar systems that came before, they tend to complement skilled workers rather than replace them. Part of the problem is that when a bot mimics conversation, it can seem smarter than it really is. When we see a flash of humanlike behavior in a pet or a machine, we tend to assume it behaves like us in other ways, too — even when it does not. The Turing test does not consider that we humans are gullible by nature, that words can so easily mislead us into believing something that is not true. The Rise of OpenAI The San Francisco company is one of the world’s most ambitious artificial intelligence labs. Here’s a look at some recent developments. ChatGPT: The cutting-edge chatbot is raising fears of students cheating on their homework. But its potential as an educational tool outweighs its risks, our technology columnist writes. DALL-E 2: The system lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see. But for some, image generators are worrisome. GPT-3: With mind-boggling fluency, the natural-language system can write, argue and code. The implications for the future could be profound. “These systems can do a lot of useful things,” said Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist at OpenAI and one of the most important A.I. researchers of the past decade, referring to the new wave of chatbots. “On the other hand, they are not there yet. People think they can do things they cannot.” As the latest technologies emerge from research labs, it is now obvious — if it was not obvious before — that scientists must rethink and reshape how they track the progress of artificial intelligence. The Turing test is not up to the task. Time and time again, A.I. technologies have surpassed supposedly insurmountable tests, including mastery of chess (1997), “Jeopardy!” (2011), Go (2016) and poker (2019). Now it is surpassing another, and again this does not necessarily mean what we thought it would. We — the public — need a new framework for understanding what A.I. can do, what it cannot, what it will do in the future and how it will change our lives, for better or for worse.

At the time, the scientific world was struggling to understand what a computer was. Was it a digital brain? Or was it something else? Turing offered a way of answering this question. He called it the “imitation game.” It involved two lengthy conversations — one with a machine and another with a human being. Both conversations would be conducted via text chat, so that the person on the other end would not immediately know which one he or she was talking to. If the person could not tell the difference between the two as the conversations progressed, then you could rightly say the machine could think. “The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include,” Turing wrote. The test could include everything from poetry to mathematics, he explained, laying out a hypothetical conversation: Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. Q: Add 34957 to 70764. A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621. Q: Do you play chess? A: Yes. Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. When Turing proposed the test, computers could not chat. Scientists communicated with these room-size machines by feeding mathematical and textual instructions into vacuum tubes via typewriters, magnetic tape and punched cards. But as the years passed and researchers created a new field they called artificial intelligence — a concerted effort to build machines that could think at the level of a human — many held up the imitation game as the ultimate goal. “People were not building systems for fluent dialogue. That was just too hard,” said Stuart Shieber, a Harvard computer scientist who specializes in computational linguistics, including the Turing test. “But it was an aspiration.” By the mid-1960s, machines could chat in small ways. And even then, they fooled people into believing they were more intelligent than they really were. Image A black-and-white portrait photo of Joseph Weizenbaum. Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at M.I.T., invented the natural language program Eliza in the 1960s.Credit...Calvin Campbell/Massachusetts Institute of Tech.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"A researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Joseph Weizenbaum, built an automated psychotherapist called Eliza, which did little more than repeat what a user said in the form of a question. But some treated this bot as if it were a human therapist, unloading their most personal secrets and feelings. Over the next several decades, chatbots improved at a snail’s pace. The best that researchers could do was lay down a long list of rules defining how a bot should behave. And no matter how many rules they wrote, they were never enough. The scope of natural language was just too big. In 2014, after nearly 60 years of A.I. research, three researchers in St. Petersburg, Russia, built a bot, called Eugene Goostman, that imitated a 13-year-old Ukrainian who had learned English as a second language. But claims from its creators — and from the news media — that it had passed the Turing test were greatly exaggerated. When asked, “Which is bigger, a shoe box or Mount Everest?,” this bot said: “I can’t make a choice right now.” When asked, “How many legs does a camel have?,” it replied: “Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-)))” Then, about three years later, researchers at places like Google and OpenAI began building a new kind of artificial intelligence. Write me a sonnet On a recent morning, I asked ChatGPT the same questions that Turing had laid out in his 1950 paper. It instantly generated a poem about the Forth Bridge: Its red paint gleams in the morning sun A sight to behold, for all to see Its majesty and grandeur never done Then it correctly added 34,957 and 70,764. It did not need 30 seconds to do so. When I laid out the end of a chess game as Turing did, it responded with typically clear, concise, confident prose. It seemed to understand the situation. But it did not. It mistook the end of the game for the beginning. “I would move my rook to R2,” it said. “It is generally a good idea to try to develop your pieces (move them out from their starting positions) as quickly as possible in chess.” ChatGPT is what researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the network of neurons in the brain. This is the same technology that translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians as self-driving cars weave through city streets. A neural network learns skills by analyzing data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of photos of stop signs, for example, it can learn to recognize a stop sign. Five years ago, Google, OpenAI and other A.I. labs started designing neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of digital text, including books, news stories, Wikipedia articles and online chat logs. Researchers call them “large language models.” Pinpointing billions of distinct patterns in the way people connect words, letters and symbols, these systems learned to generate their own text. They can create tweets, blog posts, poems, even computer programs. They can carry on a conversation — at least up to a point. And as they do, they can seamlessly combine far-flung concepts. You can ask them to rewrite Queen’s pop operetta, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” so that it rhapsodizes about the life of a postdoc academic researcher, and they will. “They can extrapolate,” said Oriol Vinyals, senior director of deep learning research at the London lab DeepMind, who has built groundbreaking systems that can juggle everything from language to three-dimensional video games. “They can combine concepts in ways you would never anticipate.” Researchers, businesses and other early adopters have been testing these systems for years. Initially, they were difficult to use. And they spat out as much nonsense as coherent language. But with ChatGPT, OpenAI has refined the technology. As people tested an early version of the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses, specifying whether they were convincing or truthful or useful. Then, through a technique called reinforcement learning, the lab used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do. The result is a chatbot geared toward answering individual questions — the very thing that Turing envisioned. Google, Meta and other organizations have built bots that operate in similar ways. The trouble is that while their language skills are shockingly impressive, the words and ideas are not always backed by what most people would call reason or common sense. The systems write recipes with no regard for how the food will taste. They make little distinction between fact and fiction. They suggest chess moves with complete confidence even when they do not understand the state of the game. Because they are trained on data from across the internet, there are an infinite number of situations where they seem to get things right while actually getting them very wrong. Dr. Sutskever of OpenAI compares these bots to the automated driving service that Tesla calls Full Self Driving. This experimental technology can drive itself on city streets. But you — the human driver — are required to keep your eyes on the road and take control of the car at any moment. “It does everything. It turns and it stops and it sees all the pedestrians,” he said. “And yet you have to intervene fairly frequently.” ChatGPT does question-and-answer, but it tends to break down when you take it in other directions. Franz Broseph can negotiate Diplomacy moves for a few minutes, but if each round of negotiations had been a little longer, Mr. De Graaff might well have realized it was a bot. And if Franz Broseph were dropped into any other situation — like answering tech support calls — it would be useless. A New Test Six months before releasing its chatbot, OpenAI unveiled a tool called DALL-E. A nod to both “WALL-E,” the 2008 animated movie about an autonomous robot, and Salvador Dalí, the Surrealist painter, this experimental technology lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see. This is also a neural network, built much like Franz Broseph or ChatGPT. The difference is that it learned from both images and text. Analyzing millions of digital images and the captions that described them, it learned to recognize the links between pictures and words. This is what’s known as a multimodal system. Google, OpenAI and other organizations are already using similar methods to build systems that can generate video of people and objects. Start-ups are building bots that can navigate software apps and websites on a user’s behalf. These are not systems that anyone can properly evaluate with the Turing test — or any other simple method. Their end goal is not conversation. Researchers at Google and DeepMind, which is owned by Google’s parent company, are developing tests meant to evaluate chatbots and systems like DALL-E, to judge what they do well, where they lack reason and common sense, and more. One test shows videos to artificial intelligence systems and asks them to explain what has happened. After watching someone tinker with an electric shaver, for instance, the A.I. must explain why the shaver did not turn on. These tests feel like academic exercises — much like the Turing test. We need something that is more practical, that can really tell us what these systems do well and what they cannot, how they will replace human labor in the near term and how they will not. We could also use a change in attitude. “We need a paradigm shift — where we no longer judge intelligence by comparing machines to human behavior,” said Oren Etzioni, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and founding chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a prominent lab in Seattle. Turing’s test judged whether a machine could imitate a human. This is how artificial intelligence is typically portrayed — as the rise of machines that think like people. But the technologies under development today are very different from you and me. They cannot deal with concepts they have never seen before. And they cannot take ideas and explore them in the physical world. ChatGPT made that clear. As more users experimented with it, they showed off its abilities and limitations. One Twitter user asked ChatGPT what letter came next in the sequence O T T F F S S, and it gave the correct answer (E). But it also told him the wrong reason it was correct, failing to realize that these are the first letters in the numbers 1 to 8. At the same time, there are many ways these bots are superior to you and me. They do not get tired. They do not let emotion cloud what they are trying to do. They can instantly draw on far larger amounts of information. And they can generate text, images and other media at speeds and volumes we humans never could. Their skills will also improve considerably in the coming years. Researchers can rapidly hone these systems by feeding them more and more data. The most advanced systems, like ChatGPT, require months of training, but over those months, they can develop skills they did not exhibit in the past. “We have found a set of techniques that scale effortlessly,” said Raia Hadsell, senior director of research and robotics at DeepMind. “We have a simple, powerful approach that continues to get better and better.” The exponential improvement we have seen in these chatbots over the past few years will not last forever. The gains may soon level out. But even then, multimodal systems will continue to improve — and master increasingly complex skills involving images, sounds and computer code. And computer scientists will combine these bots with systems that can do things they cannot. ChatGPT failed Turing’s chess test. But we knew in 1997 that a computer could beat the best humans at chess. Plug ChatGPT into a chess program, and the hole is filled. In the months and years to come, these bots will help you find information on the internet. They will explain concepts in ways you can understand. If you like, they will even write your tweets, blog posts and term papers. They will tabulate your monthly expenses in your spreadsheets. They will visit real estate websites and find houses in your price range. They will produce online avatars that look and sound like humans. They will make mini-movies, complete with music and dialogue. “This will be the next step up from Pixar — superpersonalized movies that anyone can create really quickly,” said Bryan McCann, former lead research scientist at Salesforce, who is exploring chatbots and other A.I. technologies at a start-up called You.com. As ChatGPT and DALL-E have shown, this kind of thing will be shocking, fascinating and fun. It will also leave us wondering how it will change our lives. What happens to people who have spent their careers making movies? Will this technology flood the internet with images that seem real but are not? Will their mistakes lead us astray? “All the President’s Men,” Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward’s classic tale of uncovering Watergate, tells a story about a history paper that Mr. Woodward wrote as a freshman at Yale. After reading countless documents that described King Henry IV standing barefoot in the snow for days as he waited to beg forgiveness from Pope Gregory in 1077, Mr. Woodward included the anecdote in his paper. His professor gave the paper a failing grade, explaining that no human being could stand barefoot in the snow for so long without his feet freezing off. “The divine right of kings did not extend to overturning the laws of nature and common sense,” the professor said. Drawing from endless documents about King Henry’s visit to Canossa, ChatGPT might well make the same mistake. You must play the professor. Certainly, these bots will change the world. But the onus is on you to be wary of what these systems say and do, to edit what they give you, to approach everything you see online with skepticism. Researchers know how to give these systems a wide range of skills, but they do not yet know how to give them reason or common sense or a sense of truth. That still lies with you.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"In 2013, workers at a German construction company noticed something odd about their Xerox photocopier: when they made a copy of the floor plan of a house, the copy differed from the original in a subtle but significant way. In the original floor plan, each of the house’s three rooms was accompanied by a rectangle specifying its area: the rooms were 14.13, 21.11, and 17.42 square metres, respectively. However, in the photocopy, all three rooms were labelled as being 14.13 square metres in size. The company contacted the computer scientist David Kriesel to investigate this seemingly inconceivable result. They needed a computer scientist because a modern Xerox photocopier doesn’t use the physical xerographic process popularized in the nineteen-sixties. Instead, it scans the document digitally, and then prints the resulting image file. Combine that with the fact that virtually every digital image file is compressed to save space, and a solution to the mystery begins to suggest itself. Compressing a file requires two steps: first, the encoding, during which the file is converted into a more compact format, and then the decoding, whereby the process is reversed. If the restored file is identical to the original, then the compression process is described as lossless: no information has been discarded. By contrast, if the restored file is only an approximation of the original, the compression is described as lossy: some information has been discarded and is now unrecoverable. Lossless compression is what’s typically used for text files and computer programs, because those are domains in which even a single incorrect character has the potential to be disastrous. Lossy compression is often used for photos, audio, and video in situations in which absolute accuracy isn’t essential. Most of the time, we don’t notice if a picture, song, or movie isn’t perfectly reproduced. The loss in fidelity becomes more perceptible only as files are squeezed very tightly. In those cases, we notice what are known as compression artifacts: the fuzziness of the smallest jpeg and mpeg images, or the tinny sound of low-bit-rate MP3s. Xerox photocopiers use a lossy compression format known as jbig2, designed for use with black-and-white images. To save space, the copier identifies similar-looking regions in the image and stores a single copy for all of them; when the file is decompressed, it uses that copy repeatedly to reconstruct the image. It turned out that the photocopier had judged the labels specifying the area of the rooms to be similar enough that it needed to store only one of them—14.13—and it reused that one for all three rooms when printing the floor plan. The fact that Xerox photocopiers use a lossy compression format instead of a lossless one isn’t, in itself, a problem. The problem is that the photocopiers were degrading the image in a subtle way, in which the compression artifacts weren’t immediately recognizable. If the photocopier simply produced blurry printouts, everyone would know that they weren’t accurate reproductions of the originals. What led to problems was the fact that the photocopier was producing numbers that were readable but incorrect; it made the copies seem accurate when they weren’t. (In 2014, Xerox released a patch to correct this issue.) I think that this incident with the Xerox photocopier is worth bearing in mind today, as we consider OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other similar programs, which A.I. researchers call large-language models. The resemblance between a photocopier and a large-language model might not be immediately apparent—but consider the following scenario. Imagine that you’re about to lose your access to the Internet forever. In preparation, you plan to create a compressed copy of all the text on the Web, so that you can store it on a private server. Unfortunately, your private server has only one per cent of the space needed; you can’t use a lossless compression algorithm if you want everything to fit. Instead, you write a lossy algorithm that identifies statistical regularities in the text and stores them in a specialized file format. Because you have virtually unlimited computational power to throw at this task, your algorithm can identify extraordinarily nuanced statistical regularities, and this allows you to achieve the desired compression ratio of a hundred to one. Now, losing your Internet access isn’t quite so terrible; you’ve got all the information on the Web stored on your server. The only catch is that, because the text has been so highly compressed, you can’t look for information by searching for an exact quote; you’ll never get an exact match, because the words aren’t what’s being stored. To solve this problem, you create an interface that accepts queries in the form of questions and responds with answers that convey the gist of what you have on your server. What I’ve described sounds a lot like ChatGPT, or most any other large-language model. Think of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you’re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won’t find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it’s usually acceptable. You’re still looking at a blurry jpeg, but the blurriness occurs in a way that doesn’t make the picture as a whole look less sharp. This analogy to lossy compression is not just a way to understand ChatGPT’s facility at repackaging information found on the Web by using different words. It’s also a way to understand the “hallucinations,” or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large-language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but—like the incorrect labels generated by the Xerox photocopier—they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our own knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine per cent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated. This analogy makes even more sense when we remember that a common technique used by lossy compression algorithms is interpolation—that is, estimating what’s missing by looking at what’s on either side of the gap. When an image program is displaying a photo and has to reconstruct a pixel that was lost during the compression process, it looks at the nearby pixels and calculates the average. This is what ChatGPT does when it’s prompted to describe, say, losing a sock in the dryer using the style of the Declaration of Independence: it is taking two points in “lexical space” and generating the text that would occupy the location between them. (“When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one to separate his garments from their mates, in order to maintain the cleanliness and order thereof. . . .”) ChatGPT is so good at this form of interpolation that people find it entertaining: they’ve discovered a “blur” tool for paragraphs instead of photos, and are having a blast playing with it. Given that large-language models like ChatGPT are often extolled as the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, it may sound dismissive—or at least deflating—to describe them as lossy text-compression algorithms. I do think that this perspective offers a useful corrective to the tendency to anthropomorphize large-language models, but there is another aspect to the compression analogy that is worth considering. Since 2006, an A.I. researcher named Marcus Hutter has offered a cash reward—known as the Prize for Compressing Human Knowledge, or the Hutter Prize—to anyone who can losslessly compress a specific one-gigabyte snapshot of Wikipedia smaller than the previous prize-winner did. You have probably encountered files compressed using the zip file format. The zip format reduces Hutter’s one-gigabyte file to about three hundred megabytes; the most recent prize-winner has managed to reduce it to a hundred and fifteen megabytes. This isn’t just an exercise in smooshing. Hutter believes that better text compression will be instrumental in the creation of human-level artificial intelligence, in part because the greatest degree of compression can be achieved by understanding the text. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"To grasp the proposed relationship between compression and understanding, imagine that you have a text file containing a million examples of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Although any compression algorithm could reduce the size of this file, the way to achieve the greatest compression ratio would probably be to derive the principles of arithmetic and then write the code for a calculator program. Using a calculator, you could perfectly reconstruct not just the million examples in the file but any other example of arithmetic that you might encounter in the future. The same logic applies to the problem of compressing a slice of Wikipedia. If a compression program knows that force equals mass times acceleration, it can discard a lot of words when compressing the pages about physics because it will be able to reconstruct them. Likewise, the more the program knows about supply and demand, the more words it can discard when compressing the pages about economics, and so forth. Large-language models identify statistical regularities in text. Any analysis of the text of the Web will reveal that phrases like “supply is low” often appear in close proximity to phrases like “prices rise.” A chatbot that incorporates this correlation might, when asked a question about the effect of supply shortages, respond with an answer about prices increasing. If a large-language model has compiled a vast number of correlations between economic terms—so many that it can offer plausible responses to a wide variety of questions—should we say that it actually understands economic theory? Models like ChatGPT aren’t eligible for the Hutter Prize for a variety of reasons, one of which is that they don’t reconstruct the original text precisely—i.e., they don’t perform lossless compression. But is it possible that their lossy compression nonetheless indicates real understanding of the sort that A.I. researchers are interested in? Let’s go back to the example of arithmetic. If you ask GPT-3 (the large-language model that ChatGPT was built from) to add or subtract a pair of numbers, it almost always responds with the correct answer when the numbers have only two digits. But its accuracy worsens significantly with larger numbers, falling to ten per cent when the numbers have five digits. Most of the correct answers that GPT-3 gives are not found on the Web—there aren’t many Web pages that contain the text “245 + 821,” for example—so it’s not engaged in simple memorization. But, despite ingesting a vast amount of information, it hasn’t been able to derive the principles of arithmetic, either. A close examination of GPT-3’s incorrect answers suggests that it doesn’t carry the “1” when performing arithmetic. The Web certainly contains explanations of carrying the “1,” but GPT-3 isn’t able to incorporate those explanations. GPT-3’s statistical analysis of examples of arithmetic enables it to produce a superficial approximation of the real thing, but no more than that. Given GPT-3’s failure at a subject taught in elementary school, how can we explain the fact that it sometimes appears to perform well at writing college-level essays? Even though large-language models often hallucinate, when they’re lucid they sound like they actually understand subjects like economic theory. Perhaps arithmetic is a special case, one for which large-language models are poorly suited. Is it possible that, in areas outside addition and subtraction, statistical regularities in text actually do correspond to genuine knowledge of the real world? I think there’s a simpler explanation. Imagine what it would look like if ChatGPT were a lossless algorithm. If that were the case, it would always answer questions by providing a verbatim quote from a relevant Web page. We would probably regard the software as only a slight improvement over a conventional search engine, and be less impressed by it. The fact that ChatGPT rephrases material from the Web instead of quoting it word for word makes it seem like a student expressing ideas in her own words, rather than simply regurgitating what she’s read; it creates the illusion that ChatGPT understands the material. In human students, rote memorization isn’t an indicator of genuine learning, so ChatGPT’s inability to produce exact quotes from Web pages is precisely what makes us think that it has learned something. When we’re dealing with sequences of words, lossy compression looks smarter than lossless compression. A lot of uses have been proposed for large-language models. Thinking about them as blurry jpegs offers a way to evaluate what they might or might not be well suited for. Let’s consider a few scenarios. Can large-language models take the place of traditional search engines? For us to have confidence in them, we would need to know that they haven’t been fed propaganda and conspiracy theories—we’d need to know that the jpeg is capturing the right sections of the Web. But, even if a large-language model includes only the information we want, there’s still the matter of blurriness. There’s a type of blurriness that is acceptable, which is the re-stating of information in different words. Then there’s the blurriness of outright fabrication, which we consider unacceptable when we’re looking for facts. It’s not clear that it’s technically possible to retain the acceptable kind of blurriness while eliminating the unacceptable kind, but I expect that we’ll find out in the near future. Even if it is possible to restrict large-language models from engaging in fabrication, should we use them to generate Web content? This would make sense only if our goal is to repackage information that’s already available on the Web. Some companies exist to do just that—we usually call them content mills. Perhaps the blurriness of large-language models will be useful to them, as a way of avoiding copyright infringement. Generally speaking, though, I’d say that anything that’s good for content mills is not good for people searching for information. The rise of this type of repackaging is what makes it harder for us to find what we’re looking for online right now; the more that text generated by large-language models gets published on the Web, the more the Web becomes a blurrier version of itself. There is very little information available about OpenAI’s forthcoming successor to ChatGPT, GPT-4. But I’m going to make a prediction: when assembling the vast amount of text used to train GPT-4, the people at OpenAI will have made every effort to exclude material generated by ChatGPT or any other large-language model. If this turns out to be the case, it will serve as unintentional confirmation that the analogy between large-language models and lossy compression is useful. Repeatedly resaving a jpeg creates more compression artifacts, because more information is lost every time. It’s the digital equivalent of repeatedly making photocopies of photocopies in the old days. The image quality only gets worse. Indeed, a useful criterion for gauging a large-language model’s quality might be the willingness of a company to use the text that it generates as training material for a new model. If the output of ChatGPT isn’t good enough for GPT-4, we might take that as an indicator that it’s not good enough for us, either. Conversely, if a model starts generating text so good that it can be used to train new models, then that should give us confidence in the quality of that text. (I suspect that such an outcome would require a major breakthrough in the techniques used to build these models.) If and when we start seeing models producing output that’s as good as their input, then the analogy of lossy compression will no longer be applicable. Can large-language models help humans with the creation of original writing? To answer that, we need to be specific about what we mean by that question. There is a genre of art known as Xerox art, or photocopy art, in which artists use the distinctive properties of photocopiers as creative tools. Something along those lines is surely possible with the photocopier that is ChatGPT, so, in that sense, the answer is yes. But I don’t think that anyone would claim that photocopiers have become an essential tool in the creation of art; the vast majority of artists don’t use them in their creative process, and no one argues that they’re putting themselves at a disadvantage with that choice. So let’s assume that we’re not talking about a new genre of writing that’s analogous to Xerox art. Given that stipulation, can the text generated by large-language models be a useful starting point for writers to build off when writing something original, whether it’s fiction or nonfiction? Will letting a large-language model handle the boilerplate allow writers to focus their attention on the really creative parts? Obviously, no one can speak for all writers, but let me make the argument that starting with a blurry copy of unoriginal work isn’t a good way to create original work. If you’re a writer, you will write a lot of unoriginal work before you write something original. And the time and effort expended on that unoriginal work isn’t wasted; on the contrary, I would suggest that it is precisely what enables you to eventually create something original. The hours spent choosing the right word and rearranging sentences to better follow one another are what teach you how meaning is conveyed by prose. Having students write essays isn’t merely a way to test their grasp of the material; it gives them experience in articulating their thoughts. If students never have to write essays that we have all read before, they will never gain the skills needed to write something that we have never read. And it’s not the case that, once you have ceased to be a student, you can safely use the template that a large-language model provides. The struggle to express your thoughts doesn’t disappear once you graduate—it can take place every time you start drafting a new piece. Sometimes it’s only in the process of writing that you discover your original ideas. Some might say that the output of large-language models doesn’t look all that different from a human writer’s first draft, but, again, I think this is a superficial resemblance. Your first draft isn’t an unoriginal idea expressed clearly; it’s an original idea expressed poorly, and it is accompanied by your amorphous dissatisfaction, your awareness of the distance between what it says and what you want it to say. That’s what directs you during rewriting, and that’s one of the things lacking when you start with text generated by an A.I. There’s nothing magical or mystical about writing, but it involves more than placing an existing document on an unreliable photocopier and pressing the Print button. It’s possible that, in the future, we will build an A.I. that is capable of writing good prose based on nothing but its own experience of the world. The day we achieve that will be momentous indeed—but that day lies far beyond our prediction horizon. In the meantime, it’s reasonable to ask, What use is there in having something that rephrases the Web? If we were losing our access to the Internet forever and had to store a copy on a private server with limited space, a large-language model like ChatGPT might be a good solution, assuming that it could be kept from fabricating. But we aren’t losing our access to the Internet. So just how much use is a blurry jpeg, when you still have the original? ♦\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"GitHub lays off 10% and goes fully remote Frederic Lardinois@fredericl / 1:04 PM CST•February 9, 2023 Comment GitHub homepage, silhouetteof a cat Image Credits: Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images The tech layoffs keep on coming.

With great respect for Hubbers, I first want to be clear about why we are making these decisions and what it means for GitHub’s future. Sustained growth is important for every business. For GitHub, this means that we continue to enable more productive developers across the globe and move quickly as our opportunities to help our customers change. Today, we are the home of 100M developers, and we must become the developer-first engineering system for the world of tomorrow. The age of AI has started and we have been leading this change with GitHub Copilot, our most successful product launch to date. We have an enormous opportunity to build an integrated, AI-powered GitHub with urgency. We must continue to help our customers grow and thrive with GitHub, expedite and simplify their cloud adoption journey, while supporting them every day. This will require strong focus and changes to how and where we invest our finite resources. To start, we will align our work with the areas where we can best impact these goals and our customers’ needs across all of our products. Unfortunately, this will include changes that will result in a reduction of GitHub’s workforce by up to 10% through the end of FY23. A number of Hubbers will receive notifications today, others will follow as we are re-aligning the business through the end of FY23. The hiring pause that I announced on January 18 remains in effect. Although our entire leadership team has carefully deliberated this step and come to agreement, ultimately, as CEO the decision is mine. I recognize this will be difficult on you all, and we will approach this period with the utmost respect for every Hubber. We will speak with impacted Hubbers so that they understand the transition compensation and COBRA/COBRA equivalent (outside the US) that will be provided. Career transition services assistance benefits will also be offered. Additionally, we have been working to improve our operational efficiency and scale as a business. One of our decisions is to move toward a fully remote GitHub. We are seeing very low utilization rates in our offices around the world, and this decision is a testament to the success of our long-standing remote-first culture. We are not vacating offices immediately, but will move to close all of our offices as their leases end or as we are operationally able to do so. We will share more workplace details and transition plans with you as they are finalized. We are looking at further reducing our operating costs. We will share details and transition plans with you in the coming months, but I wanted to share two decisions with you: i) Effective immediately, we will be moving laptop refreshes from three years to four years. ii) We will be moving to Microsoft Teams for the sole purpose of video conferencing, saving significant cost and simplifying cross-company and customer conversations. This move will be complete by September 1, 2023. We will remain on Slack as our day-to-day collaboration tool. Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to every single Hubber and their incredible talents that have helped GitHub grow to where we are today. Every commit you have made and every day you have worked has helped construct GitHub into the largest and most important software development platform.

Once the plasma is heated to over 100 million degrees, fusion reactions can take place. A tokamak may offer a direct route to a working power plant, but when ITER was proposed in the 1980s, the magnets available at that point required that it be a large machine.

SIMON SIMARD/THE GLOBE AND MAIL For Dr. Whyte, who once imagined that ITER would become his ultimate career destination, the project’s prolonged timeline and escalating cost became the impetus for looking at tokamaks differently. “If fusion is so important,” he began asking himself a decade ago, “why do we have only one project in the world to do this?” Born and raised in Saskatchewan, Dr. Whyte has deep roots in fusion. After studying as an engineering physicist, he did his PhD work using a tokamak built by Hydro-Québec in Varennes, near Montreal. In the 1990s, he was on a Canadian-sponsored fellowship with General Atomics in San Diego when Ottawa cancelled its support for fusion research. Without a program to return home to, Dr. Whyte and his wife stayed on in the U.S. After stints at the University of California and the University of Wisconsin, he found his way to MIT in 2006. There, Dr. Whyte began to see a different path. He prodded his students to consider whether the advent of stronger magnets than those used by ITER could make a tokamak that could reach net energy but that was smaller and therefore cheaper to build. Other players have made similar calculations. Among the more than 30 companies now pursuing commercial fusion worldwide, a common theme is that ideas once considered technically infeasible are now benefiting from new technologies that could fast track fusion energy at a scale and cost that is realistic for consumer power generation. General Fusion in Vancouver, co-founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, has been developing an approach called targeted magnetic fusion, first explored by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the 1970s. Like Commonwealth in Massachusetts, the Canadian company is preparing to build a device that will demonstrate its reactor concept. After reaching an agreement with the UK Atomic Energy Authority, General Fusion has selected a site at Culham, Oxfordshire, in England for its demonstration reactor. Nearby is the Joint European Torus, or JET, currently the world’s largest operating tokamak, which set a record in 2021 for the most energy produced in a fusion reaction. With construction slated to begin this year, General Fusion aims to have its machine up and running by 2027. “It’s really about executing on our plan over the next few years to demonstrate at large scale and ultimately get energy on the grid in the early 2030s,” said Greg Twinney, the company’s chief executive officer. In addition to the money it has raised from investors, this week General Fusion confirmed that it is asking the Canadian government for $335-million more to support its commercialization strategy. The company has said that the funding could be part of a larger government investment in a Canadian fusion hub, and it has gathered industry and academic support for the idea in advance of the coming federal budget. In a world looking to meet growing energy demands while also shifting away from fossil fuels, the pitch for commercial fusion is obvious. “When you look at the long term, when you do the math, you need something like fusion,” said Brandon Sorbom, a former student of Dr. Whyte who is now chief scientific officer at Commonwealth. “In the shorter term,” he said, “I think it makes sense that we get to it as soon as possible.” The great irony of fusion energy is that it is so ubiquitous and yet so hard to replicate. A dazzling view of the Milky Way on a moonless night is simply the light of billions of fusion reactors blazing away without human assistance. Down on Earth, conventional nuclear power plants run on fission, a nuclear reaction that relies on the splitting of uranium, the heaviest naturally occurring element, to produce enough heat to drive a generator. By contrast, fusion turns light elements into heavier ones. Igniting the process requires a challenging combination of high temperature, pressure and timing. For that reason, a fusion reaction demands a vast amount of energy input up front, but the result releases about 10 times more energy than fission does per weight of the atoms involved, and several million times more than oil or coal.\"\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The quest to harness fusion Fusion is what happens when atomic nuclei combine under high temperature or pressure and liberate energy. It is the process that powers the sun and stars. Where the energy comes from A blast of light The fusion reaction that takes the lowest input energy is the collision of deuterium and tritium to make helium. This produces a single neutron, which carries 80 per cent of the energy gained from the reaction. The neutron's energy is converted to heat when it runs into other atoms. At the U.S. National Ignition Facility, scientists attain fusion by firing laser light into a small cylinder containing a fuel pellet made of deuterium and tritium. The pellet implodes under pressure, momentarily creating conditions that enable fusion reactions.

The magnets confine a high temperature plasma in which particles of deuterium and tritium can fuse. Commonwealth Fusion Systems and ITER both use this approach. Vancouver company General Fusion is building a demonstration reactor in which plasma is confined inside a spinning layer of liquid metal. Powerful pistons are then triggered which squeeze the metal and compress the plasma. Fusion occurs at peak compression and then the cycle is repeated again and again. Pistons Hot plasma Liquid metal Magnets Electrified plasma IVAN SEMENIUK AND JOHN SOPINSKI/THE GLOBE AND MAIL, SOURCE: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY; GRAPHIC NEWS; COMMONWEALTH FUSION SYSTEMS; GENERAL FUSION The easiest way to achieve fusion in a reactor is by bringing together two forms of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium. If the two nuclei collide with enough force to overcome the positive electrical charge that pushes them apart, they can produce a single nucleus of helium. This so-called D-T reaction also releases a neutron, a subatomic particle, which carries away about 80 per cent of the energy gained in the reaction. When the neutron collides with its surroundings, the energy of its motion is converted to heat. Deuterium occurs naturally, and accounts for about one out of every 5,000 hydrogen atoms found in seawater. Tritium, which is radioactive with a half-life of a little more than 12 years, is another matter. Currently, Canada has much of the world’s non-military supply of tritium because it is a byproduct of the country’s 19 Candu nuclear reactors, which provide power in Ontario and New Brunswick. As fusion companies seek to realize their plans, there is the potential for a tritium shortage, particularly once ITER comes online in the 2030s. But most fusion reactor plans include using neutrons from fusion reactions to turn a surrounding layer of lithium into additional tritium, so that fusion can be self-sustaining. If all of this works, fusion comes with the same upsides as conventional nuclear power with fewer of the downsides. Fusion does not release carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions, and, unlike renewables, it can deliver energy without interruption and be set up virtually anywhere. Because fusion is hard to sustain, it also shuts itself off without continuous encouragement, like a match trying to light wet wood. So, in a fusion reactor, there is no equivalent to a meltdown – the kind of runaway reaction that led to disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. Nevertheless, fusion requires some handling of radioactive materials, including tritium. Over time, parts of a fusion reactor would become radioactive through absorbing neutrons and would require safe disposal and long-term storage. Exactly how much material would need to be stored, and for how long, depends on the particular approach. All of these considerations have long been a feature of fusion. What has changed lately is the potential for new advances to lower the cost of fusion just as the climate crisis has put a new premium on reducing carbon emissions. “I think the big difference right now is the interest in energy from the perspective of low greenhouse gas emissions and anything that falls into that category,” said Axel Meisen, president of the Fusion Energy Council of Canada, a non-profit organization established in 2016 to promote Canadian participation in the development of fusion. While companies driving the current wave of enthusiasm are diverse, what separates most of them is mostly how they propose to bring together deuterium and tritium.\"\n      })]\n    }), _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Dr. Norman Rostoker, the Canadian co-founder of California-based TAE Technologies. The company is currently developing a system based on a principle known as 'field-reversed configuration.' HANDOUT Among the oldest is TAE, a California-based company co-founded in 1998 by Canadian physicist Norman Rostoker. Instead of a tokamak, the company is developing a system that involves firing plasma into a cylindrical chamber where it forms a smoke-ring-like structure that generates its own self-confining magnetic field. The principle, known as field-reversed configuration, is also favoured by Helion Energy Inc., based in Everett, Wash. In contrast, First Light Fusion, based in Britain, is foregoing plasma and seeking to trigger fusion through the rapid compression of specially-designed fuel targets. The idea is like the one employed by the National Ignition Facility, except that it replaces a costly laser with a giant gun that fires projectiles at the targets with velocities approaching 20 times the speed of sound. In Canada, General Fusion has bet on a hybrid model in which hot magnetized plasma is confined inside a spinning vortex of liquid metal. The vortex is surrounded by powerful pistons which can apply a sudden squeeze to the metal, in turn compressing the plasma to a point at which fusion can momentarily occur. The cycle then repeats, like an engine. A key feature of the design is that it requires only conventional electromagnets, without the need for superconducting materials, thereby reducing costs. In December, General Fusion announced that the results it has achieved so far suggest the process can achieve fusion when scaled up to the size of the demonstration machine the company is preparing to build at Culham in Britain. The test device will aim for a type of fusion that uses deuterium plasma only. While it will not achieve net energy, its success would set the stage for a deuterium-tritium reactor, about 40-per-cent larger, that would cross that threshold and form the basis for a commercial reactor. Mr. Twinney, who joined General Fusion in 2020 and became CEO last year, acknowledged the quickening pace of developments in commercial fusion as more players enter the area, aiming to bring similar demonstrations online at about the same time. “The prize is huge,” he said. “So much work has gone into this for a lot of decades that we are all confident we’ve got the right ingredients now to put it all together.” As part of its plans, General Fusion has signed a memorandum of understanding with Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Chalk River, Ont. The research facility is equipped to work with, and test, technologies related to tritium handling that will be needed in a future pilot power plant. First Light Fusion has announced a similar arrangement.

Over the past year, the company has grown to more than 400 staff. Many of them work in the main building, which also houses the manufacturing facility for building the high-temperature superconducting magnets that will encase the company’s first reactor, dubbed SPARC. Through a picture window in a NASA-like control room, a second building that will house the reactor can be seen in the final stages of construction. “We want this to be a very boring device,” said Dr. Sorbom, meaning the fewer surprises the better. Apart from its use of high-temperature superconducting magnets, the reactor was designed along the well-studied lines of a traditional tokamak. The company has the 10 grams of tritium it will need to run SPARC, but it has not divulged the supplier. The primary goal of the project is to test the various aspects of the reactor’s compact design, including how it will remove the helium that will otherwise build up as fusion takes place and dampen the reactor’s ability to sustain its energy output. Renderings of SPARC from Commonwealth Fusion Systems. COMMONWEATH FUSION SYSTEMS Along the way, the machine will have other important hurdles to clear. For example, its ultrapowerful magnets could still face technical obstacles at the extremes at which the machine needs to operate. But if all goes to plan, the machine will achieve net energy at some point after it begins operating in 2025 – perhaps reaching 10 times that based on the company’s calculation. After that, the next step is a prototype power plant that uses the heat from fusion energy to generate electricity, ready some time in the 2030s. But as exciting as it will be if the commercial players reach their goals, it is unlikely that fusion reactors will have significant presence on power grids before 2040, let alone deliver the world from carbon by 2050. “It would be extremely premature to start putting fusion into electricity supply assumptions, at any point through the middle of this century,” analysts with the U.S. investment firm Raymond James Financial Inc. wrote in a December brief. Other veteran fusion analysts agree. Despite recent progress, fusion energy is not a ready-made escape hatch from dealing with tough choices around carbon emissions.

Winnow the layers of middle management that have accumulated over time, many promoted gradually beyond their capability, and now incapable of change. They are often out of touch with the products and teams that they own. They compound the problem by hiring more layers of directors, program managers, product managers, chiefs of staff, and more people to meet with and get presentations from and delegate to. Instead, increase manager fanout and decrease the depth of the organizational hierarchy. The recent layoffs should perhaps have focused more on managers and directors and VPs. I don’t want anyone to lose their jobs, but maybe they should learn to become valuable individual contributors again, get their hands dirty, and do real tangible valuable work. For the mid-level managers and leads, please question some of the conventional wisdom accumulated over the last 25 years. An isolated tech stack guarantees inefficiency not efficiency. Embrace agile or lean development — waterfall techniques are antiquated. “Enterprise customers” is not an excuse to build complicated crap slowly. Decide which (few!) products need legal review and let the others run faster. Treat employees as unique people with special talents rather than replaceable lego blocks at generic ladder levels. Expect and incentivize each employee to do their unique best, rather than restrict them to the low-bar average expectation for their level. Encourage teams to make promises to customers and keep those promises.
