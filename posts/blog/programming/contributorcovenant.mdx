Many Open Source projects need a [Code of Conduct](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq#cocfaqnegative) to protect the freedom and equity needed in these virtual environments. Knowing the need for this kind of norms where a collective coding experience takes place, [Coraline Ada Ehmke](http://where.coraline.codes/) has created a standard [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/).

This project hopes to increase the diversity of contributors, the number of women, people of color, and other vulnerable populations, so they can freely contribute with new ideas and points of view. The main problem is that many open source projects originate in meritocratic communities, which end up alienating some people and discriminating others by assuming that everyone has the same amount of resources, time and personal experiences.

Coraline, in addition to creating the code of conduct, has contributed to countless open source [projects](https://github.com/CoralineAda/). Caroline's views of inclusion and diversity are expressed in detail within three posts she made for [Model View Culture](https://modelviewculture.com/) magazine:

1. [Codes of Conduct 2014](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/codes-of-conduct-when-being-excellent-is-not-enough).
2. [Meritocracy](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy).
3. [Codes of Conduct 2015](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-new-normal-codes-of-conduct-in-2015-and-beyond).

The software industry has developed a meritocratic system that appears to be inclusive, yet it is nothing more than another power system in urgent need of diversification if it hopes to avoid the normalization of its current discriminatory practices. In other words in a meritocratic system great intellectual contributors are justified by their position of power and influence to discriminate other members of their community, this is a common dehumanizing and utilitarian philosophy.

Aside from its work on ethical coding and the contributor covenant Caroline has participated in many interesting conferences:

1. [Artisans and Apprentices 2014](https://youtu.be/96cqqEfGSFg): Compares differences between current educational and job opportunities with those a millennium ago.
2. [Alchemy and Identity of Programmers 2014](https://youtu.be/lZ0UYq2UJUw): The beginnings of Alchemy where analogous to the recent practice of software development, programmers must be vigilant in an industry where the rules change day by day.
