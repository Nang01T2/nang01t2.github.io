Developers prefer Python because of its easy-to-learn, flexibility, fast development, easy-to-code, readability, and many other development choices. From nowhere in the 2000s to the most used programming language right now, Python has come a long way with help of a strong community. But, there has been always a discussion on Python&#x27;s choice for computation-intensive tasks like Machine Learning as Python is generally slow compared to widely used languages like C/C++ and Java. Even with the development of computation-efficient libraries and packages like Numpy, still Python is slow for general usage.</p>

As CPython is implemented in C, objects created in Python are called PyObjects which are struct in C that refers to all Python objects.</p>

This does not mean we cannot use more threads, but it is hard and takes more time compared to multi-threading in other languages because CPython creates a separate environment for each thread. This limits multi-threading in Python to use only in situations where threads wait for external processes to complete like I/O operations, network requests, etc.</p>
