# Economics Engineering #

## Introduction ##

Discipline that integrates engineering and economy in order to **make decisions** based on the reasonable formulation, comparison, estimation and evaluation of multiple investment alternatives. It provides tools to assess their technical and economical feasibility as well as their opportunity costs in order to measure, determine and recommend the best course of action that generates the greatest added value keeping the company profitable and competitive.

### Decision Making Process ###

1. Identify the problem to solve e.g. the need for a new car.
2. Clearly define the objectives e.g. the desire for safety and low cost.
3. Gather the relevant information e.g. technical and financial data related to buying a car.
4. Identify the relevant alternatives e.g. choosing between 3 specific models. 
5. Select a decision criteria e.g. additional desire for low maintenance cost.
6. Choose the best alternative e.g. choosing 1 of the models.

We can apply the decision making process when making decisions about investments such as quality improvements, new product development, expansion of existing products, equipment purchasing, equipment replacement, selecting a manufacturing process or cost reduction strategies.

### Economics Engineering Concepts ###

* Money: Medium of exchange in legal tender.
* Cash: Coins or bills that represent a specific quantity of money.
* Period: Specific interval of time.
* Company: Autonomous production unit that generates goods for profit.
* Cash flow: Inflow (positive or income) and outflow (negative or expenses) of money.
* Investment: Disbursement of financial resources to acquire instruments of production (capital goods).

### Financial Statements ###

1. Balance Sheet or Statement of Financial Situation: Contains information about what the company has (assets and rights) and what it owes (debts and capital).
2. Income Statement: Compares the income and expenditures by describing the profits or utilities (income greater than expenses) and losses (income less than expenses) in a period of time. 
3. Cash Flows Statement: Generation or reduction of cash resources by describing the balance between the money that enters and the money invested.

In general the use of other people's goods, including money, implies a payment called interest. This payment incentives you to circulate your own goods, for example by saving your money in a bank instead of saving yourself with the objective of collecting interest.

### Economics Engineering Principles ###

1. Money's value varies through time: This means that a sum of money will have different values depending on where it stands in time with relation to the present and in general the value of the same quantity of money will be worth more the closer it's to the present.
2. You must consider the opportunity cost: Good economic decisions take into account the differences between alternative courses of action including the cost of choosing one alternative instead of another. This is done to use the limited resources in the most effective way possible.
3. Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost: This means that the marginal revenue (additional revenue from increased activity) must be greater than the costs related to the same increase in activity. In other words, since resources (natural, human, capital) are limited you must choose the increases in revenue that correspond to the lowest increases in costs.
4. Increasing risk must also increase revenue: This means that for any additional risk taken you must guarantee to investors that the increase in revenue at minimum will be able to offset any anticipated or expected risks such as the rate of inflation.

## Time Value of Money TVM (VDT) ##

When evaluating a project as an investment we must consider the value of money over time, a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum in the future due to its earnings potential in the interim, that's why we must consider the following concepts:

* Interest: Monetary charge for the privilege of using the resources of another financial entity, for investments it is the magnitude that represents the cost of money as an expression of TVM.
* Interest Rate: Percentage applied periodically to a sum of money to determine the amount of interest that it will accumulate.
* Simple Interest: Charges the interest rate to a constant initial amount.
* Compound Interest: Charges the interest rate to an initial sum and to any previously considered interest. Unless stated otherwise we will always assume to be working with compound interest.

### Simple and Compound Interest ###

For unitary cash flows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Simple Interest Is given PV, N, i}\\
	Is = (PV)(N)(i)\\
	\text{Simple FV given PV, N, i}\\
	FV = PV + (Is)\\
	\text{Simple N given Is, PV, i}\\
	N = \frac{Is}{((PV)(i))}\\
	\text{Compound FV given PV, N, i, n}\\
	FV = PV\left(1+(\frac{i}{n})\right)^{((n)(N))}\\
	\text{Compound Interest I given PV, N, i, n}\\
	I = (FV) - PV\\
	\text{Compound PV given FV, N, i, n}\\
	PV = FV\left(1+(\frac{i}{n})\right)^{(-(n)(N))}\\
	\text{Compound N given FV, PV, i, n}\\
	N = \frac{\ln(\frac{FV}{PV})}{N(\ln(1+(\frac{i}{n})))} \\
	\text{Compound i given FV, PV, N, n}\\
	i = N\left(\left(\frac{FV}{PV}\right)^{\frac{1}{(n)(N)}}-1\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

In Excel this would correspond to:

```bash
Simple Interest Is given PV, N, i
=(PV*N*i)

Simple FV given PV, N, i
=(PV)*(PV*N*i)

Simple N given Is, PV, i
=(VF-VP)/(VP*i)

Compound FV given PV, N, i, n
=FV(i/n, N*n, , -PV)

Compound Interest I given PV, N, i, n
=FV(i/n, N*n, , -PV) - PV

Compound PV given FV, N, i, n
=PV(i/n, N*n, , -FV)

Compound N given FV, PV, i, n
=NPER(i/n, , PV, -FV)

Compound i given FV, PV, N, n
=RATE(N*n, , PV, -FV)
```

### Annuities and Perpetuities ###

* Annuities: Periodic series of cash flows affected by the same interest rate (constant) where the quantities are equal in magnitude and equidistant through time (n periods). 
	* Prepaid Annuities: This are annuities that are paid at the start of their periods e.g. rent and college tuition.
	* Ordinary (Expired) Annuities: This are annuities that are paid at the end of their periods e.g. electricity (services) and cellular data. Unless stated otherwise we will always assume to be working with Ordinary Annuities.
* If there is a combination of unitary payments and annuities we can calculate the equivalent value of every cash flow and combine them into a single annuity, this process generally involves obtaining the total present or future value and then obtaining the equivalent annuity for that particular value.
* Perpetuity: Annuity expected to obtain a constant flow without a limit of time (more than 20 or 30 years). For economic evaluation this value is useful as tool to decide if we want to accept an annuity or it would be more convenient to have a single cash flow payment (as long as we have the money available).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Annuity A given PV, N, i, n}\\
	A = PV\left(\frac{i}{1-(1+i)^{N}}\right)\\
	A = PV\left(\frac{\frac{i}{n}(1+\frac{i}{n})^{Nn}}{(1+\frac{i}{n})^{Nn}-1}\right)\\
	\text{Annuity A given FV, N, i, n}\\
	A = FV\left(\frac{i}{(1+i)^{N}-1}\right)\\
	A = FV\left(\frac{\frac{i}{n}}{(1+\frac{i}{n})^{Nn}-1}\right)\\
	\text{PV given A, N, i, n}\\
	PV = A\left(\frac{1-(1+i)^{N}}{i}\right)\\
	PV = A\left((\frac{1}{i/n})-\frac{1}{\frac{i}{n}(1+\frac{i}{n})^{Nn}}\right)\\
	\text{FV given A, N, i, n}\\
	FV = A\left(\frac{(1+i)^{N}-1}{i}\right)\\
	FV = A\left(\frac{(1+\frac{i}{n})^{Nn}-1}{\frac{i}{n}}\right)
	\text{PV given Perpetuity A and i}\\
	PV = A\left(\frac{1-(1+i)^{\infty}}{i}\right) = \frac{A}{i}
\end{gathered}
$$

```bash
Annuity given PV, N, i, n
=PMT(i/n, N*n, -PV)

Annuity given FV, N, i, n
=PMT(i/n, N*n, , -PV)

PV given A, N, i, n
=PV(i/n, N*n, A)

FV given A, N, i, n
=FV(i/n, N*n, A)

PV given A, i
=A/i
```

* Amortization Tables
	* Equal (Leveled) Payments (L): Amortization scheme used when there is stability in the interest rates.
	* Equal Payments to Capital (C): Amortization scheme used when rates are variable, making the calculations easier.

```bash
C Starting Balance SB
=PreviousFB
C Payment P
=I+CP
C Interest I
=i*SB
C Capital Payment CP
=-VP/(Nn)
C Final Balance FB
=PreviousFB+CP

L Starting Balance SB
=PreviousFB
L Payment P
=PMT(i/n, N*n, PV)
L Interest I
=IPMT(i/n, NN, N*n, PV)
L Capital Payment CP
=PPMT(i/n, NN, N*n, PV)
L Final Balance FB
=PreviousFB+CP
```

### Linear Gradient ###

* Series where the cash flows increase or decrease by a uniform value (constantly). It can increase if a client wants to increase orders incrementally to test the flexibility of the market or it can decrease for maintenance costs that increase over time from spare parts that become more expensive.
	* From the second period to the last a constant quantity (gradient) identified as (G) is added to every cash flow. This creates a rectangular shape (annuity A1) with a triangular shape (gradient A2) on top.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{A1 LG given A, i, N, n}\\
	A_1 = PV\left(\frac{i}{1-(1+i)^{N}}\right)\\
	\text{A2 LG given A, G, i, N, n}\\
	A_2 = G\left(\frac{1}{i} - \frac{n}{(1+i)^n -1}\right)\\
	\text{A given A1, A2}\\
	A = A_1 + A_2
\end{gathered}
$$

```bash
A2 LG given A, G, i, n, N
=PV*((1/(i/n))-((N*n)/((1+(i/n))^(N*n)-1)))

A given A1, A2
=A1+A2
```

### Geometric Gradient ###

* Series where the cash flows increase or decrease by a constant percentage (rate of change or growing annuity G) in a geometric shape that can be calculated using a geometric gradient.
	* Geometric gradient formulas always give the result in terms of the present value, therefore you must calculate the future value as a single payment after calculating the present value.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{GG given i is not equal to g}\\
	P_g = A_1\left[\frac{1-\left(\frac{1+g}{1+i}\right)^n}{i-g}\right]\\
	\text{GG given i is equal to g}\\
	P_g = A_1\left[\frac{n}{1+i}\right]\\
\end{gathered}
$$

```bash
PV of GG given i is not equal to g
=A1*((1-(((1+g)^n)/(1+i)))/(i-g))

PV of GG given i is equal to g
=A1*(n/(1+
i))
```

### Nominal and Effective Interest Rates ###

* Discreet capitalization is the compounded interest rate applied to a capital at discreet time intervals. In contrast, continuous capitalization is used mostly for financial forecasting. Unless stated otherwise we will always assume to be working with Discreet Capitalization.
	* Nominal interest rates are usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR) quantity of informative value to the consumer, however they don't take into account further capitalization periods (semester, bimester, monthly, daily, etc)
	* Effective interest rates take into account capitalization periods that compound the nominal interest rates. Effective rates are the annual yield obtained at the end of the period when the nominal rate (i) is capitalized (n) times in a period (N).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Effective Rate given i, n, N}\\
	TAE = \left(1+(\frac{i}{n})\right)^{N}-1
\end{gathered}
$$

### Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return MARR (TREMA) ###

* MARR is related to the opportunity cost of capital of the available investment alternatives, established by senior management as the basis at which the investment project analysis, including cash flow value calculation, must be carried out.
	* MARR calculation with own capital: $MARR = i + f + if$ where (i) is the risk reward and (f) is the inflation rate. It is common to use the geometric average of the last 5 years of accumulated annual inflation rate for the value of (f).
	* MARR calculation with contributions (Mixed capital): $MARR = \sum_{k=1}^{n} ((C)(M_k))$ where (Mk) is the minimum acceptable rate from investors, (n) is the number of investors and (C) is the contribution rate of investor (k).
* Risk Reward Stages:
	* Low Risk (3% - 6%): Product or service demand is stable without strong competition, product is well positioned such as tutoring.
	* Medium Risk (6% - 12%): Projects that have a considerable demand and competence variability, for example a clothing store.
	* High Risk (12%): The price of the product varies constantly, for example entrepreneurship ideas, fashion, collectibles, etc.

### Profitability Criterion ###

By considering that every investment has an investment period (loss) and an operation period (gain) we can characterize its financial performance using the following criterion.

* Discounted Payback Period PP (PR): Simple criterion that calculates the number of years needed before the initial investment is recovered.
* Net Present Value NPV (VPN): Equivalence analysis method where every cash flow is reduced into its present value. It is used for capital budgets and investment planning in present time, calculated by substracting the initial investment (CO) from the present value of the cash flows (CT) at a discount rate (R).
	* If greater than 0 then the investment is considered profitable as it will have higher profits than the discount rate, if equal to 0 then use other profitability criterion since it doesn't generate any apparent profit, if less than 0 then the investment will have losses lower than the discount rate therefore it can't be considered profitable.
* Internal Rate of Return IRR (TIR):  Shows the maximum MARR possible for an investment before it starts operating at a loss. We will consider simple or conventional investments, meaning that there will be a single TIR value where the cash flow changes from a negative to a positive or vice versa. This criterion is related to the NPV calculation where we solve for (R) when the equation is equal to zero.
	* If IRR is greater than MARR then the project is profitable, if IRR is less than MARR then the project will operate at a loss.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Payback Period}\\
	PP = \frac{VP_0}{VP_n}\\
	\text{Net Present Value}\\
	NPV	= -C_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{C_t}{(1+R)^t}\\
	\text{Internal Rate of Return}\\
	0	= -C_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{C_t}{(1+(IRR))^t}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

MIRR

To use IRR in unconventional flows, it is necessary to carry multiple rates that help us to take from an unconventional flow to a conventional one.
The estimation of the IRR presents results of multiple rates, it is recommended to use the modified internal rate of return TIRM

The rates that are generally used are THE REINVESTMENT OR TREASURY RATE (Safe when you have the money)
THE FINANCING RATE (median when you don't have it)

1. Take the positive flows to a future value using the reinvestment rate
1. Bring negative flows to a present value using the funding rate
1. Estimate the final rate (i) that balances the present value and the future value
1. We conclude that the project is profitable if the final rate is greater than or equal to the MARR of the investment.

VAE

This method allows us to make the NPV comparison regardless of whether the MARR or the years is different, given that
performs the present value comparison on an annual basis. Of profitability.

TO GO

For each peso you have a profit, it is a profitability index.

COSTS TO INVESTIGATE
FIXED, VARIABLE, DIRECT, INDIRECT
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS AND EXPENSES
FROM THE PRODUCT IS READY IT IS AN EXPENSE, BEFORE IT IS A COST
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, SELLER'S TRANSPORTATION, SELLER'S CARS
COST IS TRANSPORTATION FROM FACTORY TO POINT OF SALE

WHAT MAKES UP OUR CASH FLOW FOR THE PROJECTI

***


* Projects can be independent or mutually exclusive

1. Criteria for Evaluation of Alternatives
1. Project proposals are formulated based on ideas, plans, information, trends, experience and estimates.
1. It is determined if the project is technically viable or not, economically, etc.
1. Viable projects are categorized as mutually exclusive or independent.
1. It is determined if the alternative is income or service and through an economic analysis the best alternative is selected.

* Independent projects can be selected all positive or none if their NPVs are negative.
* In this case the selection of the group's project proposals are independent of the selection of others.
* An acceptance table is made where all the combinations are independent (ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS)
* Where 1 and 0 are selected depending on whether the NPV is positive or negative.
* IN THIS CASE IT IS ENOUGH WITH THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
* Mutually exclusive projects are selected among the alternatives by the highest evaluation result
* You can also select none if the results are negative (investment alternatives)
* EQUAL LIFE: All alternatives have the same useful life.
* If the initial investment amount is different for each alternative, and the cash flow, use the marginal analysis methodology (Defender-Challenger)
* DIFFERENT LIFE: Some of the alternatives have a different useful life. The EQUIVALENT ANNUAL VALUE methodology is recommended.
* IN THIS CASE THE EVALUATION CRITERIA IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY COST MUST BE CONSIDERED

The problem of using only evaluation criteria with PME with EQUAL LIFE but very variable (Investment) is that it can contradict, for example, the NPV AND THE TIR
Higher NPV could mean more profit in money but MAROR IRR could mean higher profitability.
What is the company looking for, what portfolio of projects compete for the budget, who makes the decision, will the surplus be reinvested, what will the company do with the money, will it be invested in another project, will it be deposited in the bank. It is worth investing extra money
THESE ARE THE CASES IN WHICH THE MARGINAL ANALYSIS (METHOD) IS USED

1. Determine which project has an IRR greater than the TREMA.
1. Order projects from smallest to largest in terms of initial investment.
1. The viable project with the lowest initial investment is the defender.
1. Compare the new challenging alternative against the defending one.
1. If the IRR of the Additional Investment and the difference in cash flows is greater than the TREMA, then the challenger wins.
1. The challenger becomes the defender. Repeat the process for all alternatives.

For different lives you can match them with three methods:

1. Minimum Common Multiple Value Method (Flows are reinvested until reaching the same common multiple period)
1. For example, if it is 5 and 7 periods, both are reinvested until reaching 35 and then, if necessary, marginal analysis is used.
1. Truncate horizon method of some of the projects.
1. For example, if it is 5 and 7, we truncate the 7 until the end of the 5th period.
1. Doing this gives the project an early salvage value (Implied Market Value) that will be used as the salvage value of the truncated project.

* Annualize initial investment
* Annualize salvage value
* Subtract the redemption value from the initial investment (annual remaining value of the Investment)
* Obtain the PV of the VRA in the year

truncation
* Obtain the PV of the VR in the year of truncation
* Add both VP to obtain the VIM, that is, the new redemption value of the truncated project


* Simply annualize the net present value based on the number of periods and the TREM
* IT IS THE MOST USED METHOD IN ANALYSIS
* However, it is vital to use TRUNK when long-term investments must be considered that are much longer than the general evaluation horizon of the project to consider a fair redemption value, something that the VAE misses.

### About Estimated Cash Flows ###

* Public Investment Projects (PIP)
* Tenders for public investment projects, similar, based on useful life IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONTEST
* Projects that can be evaluated based on experience or similar projects in the market
* Similar projects are investigated in the market, it already exists and I see how they were evaluated.
* Based on the useful life of the main asset
* If I make keys I have a press and the supplier says that the vital machine will last 10 years.
* In replacement projects (doing Economic Useful Life or VUE analysis).
* Many times if assets are constantly replaced (selling cars)
* In this case, the VUE considers that the costs of the asset increase over time and the salvage costs decrease due to depreciation or obsolescence,
* The point before they break even is the maximum point at which the asset can be replaced without being lost.
* The costs in this case are divided into capital costs and operating costs (owning and operating the asset, respectively.)

1. Initial Flow: Investment or initial flow, it is formulated based on the technical, market and labor modules necessary for the preparation of the project.
1. It contains a list with all the expenses that are made to enable the operation. Initial investment is identified, start-up costs, pre-operational expenses.
1. Includes a 6-month buffer of operating expenses to give our business a chance.
1. Operation Plan: It contemplates all flow on the progress of the project. For purposes of evaluating investments, the cash flow is the directly relevant one. This cash flow is constructed from the company's financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows), otherwise you have to search for it on the internet. . If the company is not established.
1. Expired flows
1. Fixed costs
1. Variable costs
1. Income
1. Taxes
1. Maintenance expenses and
2. Opportunity Costs: Using a resource or time in a project is the benefit that is lost by not using the resource in another activity. For the opportunity cost that you dedicate your time to the project and do not earn a salary is the salary cost at that time. It is also to determine how long I am willing to wait to settle my expected salary.
3. Sunk costs and increasing costs: We will not consider them but they are costs too far from the project, for example the cost of the car that I currently have and that I use temporarily to open the business. That is, they are previous investment expenses that are considered historical or sunk and the increase in the investment will not be included, the only time in which it is taken into account is when these may have been sold if the investment is not carried out, that is, they are incorporated into the new project. In this case, the liquidation value of the assets is relevant, taking into account the marketing of second-hand equipment such as liquidation and pricing to be considered.
4. Land: Although it can be taken as an initial cost, future appreciations are not considered as an added value. The only exception is when the project has a direct impact on the quality of the land, in this case the added value is added to the initial value to determine an appropriate liquidation value at the end of the project With this, the flows can be structured without VAT since the tax it is assumed that there is a way to recover them.

* Depreciation: is the loss of value of an asset due to wear, use or obsolescence. The main or classical methods to calculate it are
* Recovery Period (Useful Life of the Asset): Determined by the provider or through the ISR classification for taxes.
* Adjusted Base Cost (Initial Investment): The price at which it was acquired.
* Book value at the end of year X: Value that is taken annually for cash flows purposes
* It is calculated as the value of the asset after X years of use
* Equal to the adjusted base cost less the accumulated depreciation up to that moment.

1. Straight Line: Depreciation is accumulated through a fixed annual amount.
1. Accelerated Depreciation: It is calculated using a fixed percentage of the book value at the beginning of the year. In this case R is the depreciation rate.
1. Production Units: It is used in projects where the project decreases in value due to use (as time goes by it is less important).
1. For example PVC film for food

nts of different thicknesses, for different moulds.
1. There is a total of hours of life of the asset and it is depreciated according to its use, if a different number of hours is used per period
1. Then it is convenient to get the depreciation per hour and then annualize it.

* The initial investment of year 0 is considered without VAT. and is taken as a direct disbursement in the flow.
* The first year there are already operating costs (fixed and variable) that together with income give us gross profit (EBITDA)
* WAFIRDA : Income before taxes and etc. FISCO gives you the chance to make depreciation. (Deductible)
* I deduct it from the utility to lower the amount of taxes to be paid (Income Tax)
* With this you get the grave base
* Then the ISR manages 30% of taxes that are withdrawn from the taxable base (moral persons - Corporations or companies) (ON THE FISCAL RESULT OBTAINED)
* Individuals with business activity are withdrawn 25% (individuals) of income tax.
* In the event that the profits are lost, the ISR is taken as negative, that is, it is received in theory since it is not charged.
* Finally we reach the Utility after taxes. However, for cash flow purposes, Depreciation must be added back
* That is to say that the increase in depreciation as something that is obtained from the IRS is only for accounting purposes and not real.

### Inflation ###

The EVALUATION HORIZON does not depend on the duration of the project but on the objective
In one case it could be to start the project, that it begins to be profitable.
In approximately 3 years.
Income Law gives us estimates per asset over the years (INCLUDING MAXIMUM DEPRECIATION PER ASSET).

STANDARDIZE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED UP TO 90 PERCENT!! (salvage value of 10 percent RECOVERY)
ALSO LARGE CARS (10 YEARS OF USEFUL LIFE), MEDIUM CARS CARS (4 years), SMALL CARS COMPUTING FURNITURE (4 YEARS)

THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD IN MEXICO IS THE MOST USED DEPRECIATION METHOD

WE CALCULATE THE DEPRECIATION TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE ARE GOING TO DEDUCT.
OTHER TYPES OF TAX SUCH AS VAT 16 ARE IMPLIED IN OUR SALES SO THEY ARE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

ANOTHER TAX IS THE YEBS, ORIGINALLY FOR LUXURY PRODUCTS (HIGH-RANGE LUXURY)
THEN IT WAS APPLIED FOR HARMFUL PRODUCTS (ONLY PRODUCERS NOT RESELLERS) OF TOBACCO AND ALCHOL
FINALLY TO SUGAR, CONSUMPTION SALT AND FINALLY TO GASOLINE.

* YEBS are not deductible, so they are added directly to the tax column and are taken into account as a tax to be subtracted from the taxable base.

THEY WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THE PROJECT ONLY ISR TAXES WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT!!

* Also decide if a legal or physical person and apply the corresponding ISR of 30 or 25 percent.

* If an asset expires before the project ends, we have the option of repurchasing it by adjusting the depreciation (continuing it) and with the redemption.
* The other easier option is to simply continue using the asset but it would no longer generate additional depreciation.
* In the second option the salvage value remains the same until the end of the analysis when it is finally RECEIVED.


INFLATION

Not all prices grow at the same rate (CONSUMPTION)

Reasons why it happens
excess money in circulation
Technological improvements
Productivity changes
Changes in regulations
Government-imposed price restrictions
Restrictions in supply or increase in demand.
Low interest rates in banks.

Inflation is defined as the increase in the prices of goods and services in a general and sustained manner.
This means that the cost of a given item tends to increase over time.
For finance, it is the weighted and aggregate measure of the increase in prices in the basic basket of an economy.

The basic basket of a few hundred products undergoes price revisions where the inflation measure is calculated at the national (INPC) or regional level.
This measurement that is made to calculate inflation is called CONSUMER PRICES or CPI that consists of the basic basket
required for the average consumer.

1. Food, clothing, housing, furniture, health, transportation, education, others.

In turn, the components of the basket are categorized into underlying and non-core components.

* Underlying: Goods and services for which the price variation responds mainly to market conditions (Clothes, Housing, Furniture).
* Non-core: Composed of goods (unprocessed food, energy, government tariffs) and services whose prices are highly influenced by external conditions such as weather or regulations.

IT IS MADE ANNUALLY FOR THE COMPARISONS OF ONE MONTH, THE SAME MONTH LAST YEAR.

BANXICO and INEGI perform the calculation.

The increase in prices speaks of nominal figures and real figures, as well as nominal and real interest rates.
Inflation for project analysis

os is the difference between real and nominal prices.

The analysis is performed as:

* Considering Current or Circulating Pesos (A): Estimates made of future cash flows in year n based on anticipated changes in amounts due to inflation or deflation. In other words, the purchasing power is determined by the moment in which the transaction is made. We assume inflation.
* Considering Constant or Real Pesos (R): Estimates made with pesos that have the same purchasing power at any time (RESPRESSED). There is a relationship between the constant, circulating pesos and the general or average rate of inflation (f). Explicitly inflation.
 
IF I HAVE THE NOMINAL MARK I CAN GET THE REAL MARK TO MAKE MY CALCULATIONS.

ANALYSIS TO METHOD

1. Real analysis with constant or real weights. (R)
1. Taking real interest rates (Ir) and considering differential inflation (e'j)

ANALYSIS B METHOD

1. Nominal analysis with current or current weights. (A)
1. Nominal interest rates (Ic) (IF WE ARE IMPLICATELY CONSIDERING INFLATION ALREADY AT THE MARK)
1. Total inflationary interest rates. (eg)

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital WAVV ###

* Rate of Return: The rate of return of an asset is a random variable characterized by its measures of central tendency and dispersion. The standard deviation is used to represent the volatility (risk) associated with a rate of return. The easiest thing is to decrease the central tendency or WACC to maximize the profitability of the company since the volatility revolves around the WACC.
* WACC: The cost of capital rates of each source of financing are weighted according to their percentages, this average is the rate of return required by the company's assets based on the market's perception of the risk of said assets.
* Cost of Capital: Rate of return that a company must obtain on its investments to maintain its market value and continue to attract funds. It is calculated with respect to a moment and projects its cost in the future by means of an average of the funds expected in the long term with the best possible estimate. Companies tend to a target capital structure where it is necessary to analyze the general cost of capital with priority over that of a specific source. The weighted average cost of capital is the weighting of the cost of each financing source by its target proportion in the capital structure defined for the company.
* $WACC = (w_i)(k_i) + (w_p)(k_p) + (w_s)(k_{n,s})$
	* Where (wi) is the ratio of long-term debt, (wp) is the ratio of preferred stock, and (ws) is the ratio of stockholders' equity in common stock. Where (ki) is the cost of long-term debt, (kp) is the cost of preferred stock debt, and (ks) is the cost of common stock equity. (kn) can also be used instead of (ks) when using the cost of a new common stock issue.
