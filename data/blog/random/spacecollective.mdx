Space Collective was founded in 2007 by film director Rene Daalder and interactive designer Folkert Gorter as a repository of ideas related to the planet, the universe, human existance and our future as a species. The site is an experiment in the possibility of a conscience or singularity arising mearly from the evolution of the internet and stems from Voyager launch and the accompanying message from Carl Sagan.

> The internet has reopened fundamental questions about our understanding of the universe and our duty towards this new world identity, typical of the era of computing space. Human beings are becoming a single planetary entity and we have to contribute towards this new identity to through the ideas that we leave to future generations.

The site has a public blog and also each user has the right to a time capsule where he can post the information he wants to leave for posterity. Similar to time capsules there is a digital art collection since art is a deep reflection of the society that creates it. Other institutions have worked with Space Collective to get ideas for projects related to the future of humanity.
