> Digital Literacy is the skills and competencies necessary for observing and participating effectively on the internet.

Every day there are more people with internet access and this is a fact [^1], however the digital divide has not diminished with the same speed leaving most without full access to its benefits. Among the solutions, it has been proposed to establish an international educational curriculum that will teach future generations on how to correctly take advantage of the internet and understand its importance in daily life. 

It is evident that current educational systems are to slow or blatantly refuse to implement comprehensive programs that face this issue. Computer science needs to be the fourth pedagogy pillar on same level as writing, reading and mathematics. In the digital age it is our responsibility to guide children to become literate on this new global language. The Mozilla Foundation created a Digital Literacy Map[^2] that showcases the values and skills needed for anyone to exercise digital literacy.

The map is based on a body of research that began in the 90's by [SCONUL](https://www.sconul.ac.uk/page/seven-pillars-of-information-literacy) about how humans learn through digital media culminating in the *Seven pillars of information literacy* published in 1999[^3] and updated in 2015[^4]. In order for digital literacy to occur we need to know how to review, evaluate, synthesize, contribute, share, design, program, express, connect, modify and search information while being careful about potential threats.

The seven pillars coincide with the *Ideals of the Internet*:

1. Use of public, open and transparent technology.
2. There is no central authority that controls the internet.
3. Only authors can edit and control their content.
4. All citizens of the internet are equal.
5. The internet is neutral, it has no preferences or opinions.
6. The internet self-regulates its users with the use of standards.
7. Your access to the internet is a human right.

The current trend of all the internet to converge into a limited group of sites encourages large corporations to centralize information, increasing their capacity to manipulate and censor it. This trend also normalizes platforms focused on advertisements, individualism, branding and capitalization of public and private information. How can we expect the internet to grow and diversify if its average user does not understand the concept of URL, doesn't know about other search engines besides Google or other Social Networks other than Facebook? 

It may be hard to believe but a large part of internet users can't even move effectively through the jungle of buttons, text, images, symbols and other artifacts that are only instantly and naturally recognizable by a small group of people. The problem of digital illiteracy has been well defined and we have multiple solutions however we need to solve the fundamental problem of teachers and their difficulty keeping up to date with new technologies, most schools even identify the internet as an entertainment only resource instead of an indispensable teaching tool.
