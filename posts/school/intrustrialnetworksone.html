Implement networks used for programmable logic controllers, wiring and plant integration. Requires knowledge of automation and industrial computing.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>PLC</h1>
<p>A programmable logic controller, also known as a programmable automata, is a computer used in industrial automation as the controller inside control systems. It executes a set of instructions in an electromechanical process, for example an assembly line. Examples of PLC manufacturers are Siemens, Allen Bradley, Omron, Mitsubishi, Schneider, Zander Aachen and Crouzet.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/PLCArquitectureNetworks.png" alt="PLC Architecture"/></p>
<p>PLC&#x27;s have a programming unit that translates code, a memory unit that stores the code, a CPU and a power unit. The CPU is an 8, 16 or 32 bit microprocessor capable of data logic, temporalization and sequencing, communicating using a modular I/O physical interface. By interpreting inputs and logic instructions it decides what to output at any given time. One important characteristic is how quickly its able to complete a SCAN cycle.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/PLCscancycleNetworks.png" alt="PLC SCAN"/></p>
<p>The memory unit is where the main program and all its relevant data is stored, they vary according to type and capacity for example ROM, RAM, PROM, EEPROM, etc. Normally memory is specified in K units where 1K represents 1024 words in the memory register. Most PLC&#x27;s are manufactured for AC power sources but there are some models that accept DC power sources for example in offshore rig operations where DC generators are common.</p>
<p>Voltage and current requirements, usually 120VAC, 220VAC or 24VDC, must be supplied to ensure the PLC will provide the correct input and output signals. PLC are preferred in industrial environments to other controllers for their simplicity, sturdiness and reliable Input and Output interface that is specifically designed to communicate with modules and instrumentation (sensors and actuators).</p>
<p>PLC&#x27;s programming languages are used to create a program with the necessary control instructions, note that communication between PLC&#x27;s happens through communication protocols like Profibus, Fieldbus, Modbus, Devicenet, Interbus, etc. Since PLC&#x27;s are used by many professionals that don&#x27;t have a programming background it is common to see them use high level graphic languages.</p>
<p>Graphic languages use symbols to declare the instructions but are limited to the available symbol combinations, for example Ladder Logic (relay based) or Logical Symbol Blocks. Textual languages use character strings to declare the instructions and therefore are more flexible, for example Instruction List (Assembly based) or Structured Text Language (C and PASCAL based).</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Networks</h1>
<p>Communication is almost as important as any other vital resource. It creates a boundless world, global communities and information networks. Online services like mail, files and games are managed by specialized servers. Servers (HOSTS) will provide the information that a client (END DEVICE) asks for. Intermediary devices like routers connect the clients to the servers.</p>
<p><strong>Point to Point</strong></p>
<p>Point to point networks, like torrent, are networks where devices can act as clients and servers at the same time. This type of networks are easy to configure, less complex, reduce costs and are mainly used to transfer files or share other devices, however they aren&#x27;t centralized, they are unsecure, not scalable and their performance depends on the available servers at any time.</p>
<p><strong>End Device and Intermediary Device</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/NetworkTopologySymbolsNetworks.png" alt="Network Topologies"/></p>
<p>An end device is a point in the network where a message can originate or be received, for example desktops, laptops, printers, IP Phones, tablets or smartphones. Messages can take different routes, independent of the end device, through intermediary elements that forward the information. Examples of intermediary elements are LAN switches, wireless routers, firewalls, routers and multilayer routers.</p>
<p>Intermediary elements don&#x27;t store the information they forward but they do keep track of the flow of data to report errors, report communication failures, execute data management coordination and make the network more efficient overall. Information travels through mediums like copper (electrical impulses), glass fibers like optical fiber (light pulses) or wireless like air (frequency modulation of electromagnetic waves).</p>
<p><strong>Topologies</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/TypesOfTopologiesNetworks.png" alt="Network Topologies"/></p>
<p>Network topologies or diagrams represent the devices connected to a network using symbols. Devices need a NIC (Network Interface Controller) to interface into a physical network using their ports (device interfaces). Physical network topologies illustrate the placement of the devices and their wiring. Logical network topologies illustrate devices, ports and addressing schemes like IP.</p>
<p><strong>LAN and WAN</strong></p>
<p>Networks vary widely depending on their purpose and reach. Local area networks (LAN) are used to interconnect a small number of computers (fewer than a hundred) that are geographically close to each other (houses or small offices). Wide area networks (WAN) are used to interconnect a large number of computers (hundreds to thousands) that are geographically distant from each other (large companies or the internet).</p>
<p>LAN and WAN abstractions will depend on the geographical area they encompass, the number of expected users, the quantity and services available and on how reliable is the network&#x27;s infrastructure. LAN&#x27;s will usually be managed by one person or organization providing high speed bandwidth to its devices while WAN&#x27;s are generally managed by Internet Service Providers linking different LAN&#x27;s.</p>
<p><strong>Intranet, Extranet and Internet</strong></p>
<p>The internet is a global collection of LAN&#x27;s and WAN&#x27;s using copper cables, optical fiber cables and wireless transmissions. The internet is not controlled by any person or group however there are several organizations dedicated to helping maintain its physical and logical structure like the ISOC, IAB, IESG, IRSG, IRTF and IETF.</p>
<p>The intranet is a private collection of LAN&#x27;s and WAN&#x27;s accessible only to authorized members of an organization. The extranet is layer built on top of the intranet allowing controlled access to the intranet&#x27;s data to people related to the organization like clients and collaborators. The internet is the public collection of LAN&#x27;s and WAN&#x27;s that everybody is authorized to access.</p>
<p><strong>ISP Services</strong></p>
<p>ISP&#x27;s generally provide to homes and small offices the following services: Wired broadband (Cable), Digital subscriber line (DSL), Cellular network, Satellite or Dialing telephone. Entrepreneurial services include: Leased line, WAN Ethernet (Metro), SDSL or Satellite. Businesses used to be wired using separate telephone, video and data lines but today most services use convergent networks that transport data through a single line.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Every network architecture must meet the following expectations in order to be considered a <em>Reliable Network</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tolerance to failures: Systems that decrease the impact of failures by limiting the number of affected devices, like redundancy.</li>
<li>Scalability: The network can easily expand to admit new devices and applications without diminishing the overall performance.</li>
<li>Quality of Service (QoS): Systems that prioritize workloads by considering the specific needs of the network users.</li>
<li>Security: Divided into the safety of the infrastructure (physical) and the safety of the data (logical). Its main objectives are:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality: Only the desired recipients can access the data.</li>
<li>Integrity: A guarantee that the data has not been compromised during transmission.</li>
<li>Availability: A guarantee that there is a reliable and timely access to the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network Trends</strong></p>
<p>There are many trends in today&#x27;s networks including the bring your own device model (BYOD) where users want to be able to access their data on any device, anywhere. Online collaboration and videoconferences used in many companies and schools. Video communication as part of everyday life. Cloud computing allowing affordable access to computing power and storage by leasing distant cloud servers.</p>
<p>There are some technology trends too like intelligent homes interconnecting appliances, electric line network adapters that allow the use of the electric infrastructure as ethernet or wireless broadband that allow you to connect your devices to a general wireless internet tower (WISP) similar to the cellular network that smartphones use.</p>
<p><strong>Network Security</strong></p>
<p>Network protection includes protocols, technologies, devices, tools and techniques like firewalls, access control lists (ACL), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and VPN&#x27;s that mitigate external and internal threats. External threats can be viruses, trojan, worms, spyware, adware, zero day attacks, denial of service, data interception and identity theft. Internal threats can be lost or stolen devices, accidental misuse or malicious employees.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Network OS</h1>
<p><strong>Operative System</strong></p>
<p>Operating systems are built on top of abstraction layers. The hardware is the physical layer that includes the electronic devices of the OS. The kernel is the software-hardware interface in charge of distributing resources. The shell is the software interface and it&#x27;s the first layer meant for human intervention. Shells can have a text based (CLI) or graphic based (GUI) interface.</p>
<p>The CLI is the preferred operating system for network technicians to configure, monitor and control devices. To access the network OS of a device we can use a Console (serial port), Telnet (unencrypted remote network access) or a secure shell (SSH). SSH stablishes an encrypted remote CLI virtual connection. Both Telnet and SSH generally use a terminal emulator such as PuTTY, Tera Term or SecureCRT.</p>

<p><strong>Ports and IP&#x27;s</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/IPvfourandIPvsixHeadersNetworks.png" alt="IP Headers"/></p>
<p>We use IP addresses as way of locating devices inside a network, they can be configured manually or by using a dynamic service like DHCP. Currently there are two active IP standards: Version 4 and version 6.</p>
<ol>
<li>Version 4 uses a dotted decimal notation with 4 numbers between 0 and 255 making a 32 bit address. The default gateway address is the IP of the router used to access remote networks.</li>
<li>Version 6 uses 128 bit long addresses written in hexadecimal. Groups of 4 hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon. It is case insensitive.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Communication Protocol Rules</strong></p>
<p>Every communication protocol must have a source or sender, a destination or receiver and a channel or media. Protocols must define the message encoding, format, encapsulation, size, synchronization and delivery. Format is the structure applied prior to the encoding, it depends on the type of message and channel used. Delivery can be unicast (one to one), multicast (one to many) and broadcast (one for all), Broadcast is not available in IPv6, in this case we use Anycast as an alternative.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/SendingAMessageProcessNetworks.png" alt="Network Protocols"/></p>
<p>Message timing depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow control: Data transmission speed, how much data can be sent at the same time and how fast.</li>
<li>Response timeout: How long a device waits for a response or confirmation (echo).</li>
<li>Access Method: Set of rules that try to prevent collisions or establish recovery methods.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h1>Protocols</h1>
<p><strong>Protocols Used</strong></p>
<p>We use protocols so that the sender and receiver are properly identified, there is a guaranteed delivery, an efficient data flow, a continuous data sequence and data corruption detection. Protocols can work together through protocol suits like the internet (TCP/IP), most suits can be divided into their top layers (content) and lower layers (data flow).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/TCPLayerdModelNetworks.png" alt="Internet Protocol Suit"/></p>
<p>The IETF maintains the internet protocol suit, the ISO and ITU maintain the open systems interconnection protocol suit, Apple maintains its AppleTalk protocol suit and Novell maintains its Novell NetWare suit.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Layer Suit Model</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/StackLayeredModelsNetworks.png" alt="Network Protocols"/></p>
<p>Network suits are usually complex therefore we use layer models like TCP/IP or OSI to compartmentalize their protocols.</p>
<p>TCP/IP Layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Network access: Hardware connected to the network via their NIC&#x27;s (wired or wireless).</li>
<li>Internet: Determines the best path through the network via Internet Protocol addressing.</li>
<li>Transport: Communication between devices over various networks via Transmission Control Protocol.</li>
<li>Application: User data and content including their encoding and decoding platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>OSI Layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Physical: Activate and maintain physical connections. Timing and bit synchronization.</li>
<li>Data links: Exchanging data frames on a common medium using MAC addressing.</li>
<li>Network: Services for exchanging data portions over the network via IP addressing.</li>
<li>Transport: Segment, transfer and reassemble data into their predefined ports.</li>
<li>Session: Manage data exchange and provide services to the next layer.</li>
<li>Presentation: Common representation of the data transferred to the user.</li>
<li>Application: Contains protocols used for process intercommunication.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Data Encapsulation</strong></p>
<p>Segmentation is dividing the data into smaller units, multiplexing is taking multiple streams of segmented data and weaving them together. Message sequencing, like the one done by TCP, is the process of numbering data segments so that they can be reassembled. We segment data to increase its transmission speed and efficiency since large amounts of data can be sent thought multiple routes and in the case of failures only a small amount of data has to be retransmitted.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is how protocols add metainformation to data packages. Each stage of the process implicates the creation of a new protocol data unit, therefore we can subdivide the process by the PDU it creates at each stage (data, segment, package, plot or bits). In decapsulation data moves from the bottom to the top, removing their PDU headers.</p>
<p><strong>Data access</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/LocalAndRemoteAddressingRoutingNetworks.png" alt="Local and Remote Access"/></p>
<p>Source and destination IP addresses in the Network Layer (L3) are responsible for sending the IP packet from source to destination. Data links in the Data Link Layer (L2) are responsible for sending data link frames from one NIC to another NIC.</p>
<p>First PC1 sends a data frame from its NIC to its default gateway DGW interface (R1), then the router sends the frame to an additional router (R2) and finally the last router sends the frame to the NIC of its original destination a Web Server. For remote data access we can see that the local addressing via MAC addresses (L2 Header) changes every hop but the remote addressing via IP addresses (L3 Header) remains intact.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Physical Layer</h1>
<p><strong>First Layer</strong></p>
<p>Before any network communication can occur a physical connection to the local network must be established. The wired or wireless Network Interface Card is used to make this connection. It accepts an entire data frame and encodes it before sending it to the next device. Standards relating to this layer are implemented in hardware and therefore are managed by many organizations (ISO, ANSI, IEEE) while the rest of the TCP/IP stack is implemented in software and managed by the IETF.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/EncodingOfDifferentMediaNetworks.png" alt="Encoding Media"/></p>
<p>The physical layer standard defines the physical components, coding and signaling needed for communication between devices. Physical components include NICs, interfaces, connectors and cables. There is a necessary encoding stage where a bit stream is translated into a recognizable signal by the following NIC, for example the Manchester encoding 4B/5B or 8B/10B. The signaling defines what will be considered 1 or 0 and it depends on the medium (wireless, optic fiber, cable).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DigitalModulationMediumAirNetworks.png" alt="FSK ASK PSK QAM"/></p>
<p>Latency is the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one device to another. Performance is a measure of how many bits are transferred over a period of time. Useful transfer capacity is a measure of how many useful bits are transferred over a period of time. Performance will be heavily dependent on the technology used and the medium&#x27;s bandwidth, its fundamental unit is 1 bit per second (1 bps).</p>
<p><strong>Copper Wiring</strong></p>
<p>Copper wiring is the most common type used as it is inexpensive, easy to install and has a low resistance. Its main drawbacks are its attenuation over long distances and its susceptibility to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Crosstalk. Its drawbacks can be mitigate using wire length limits, metallic shielding, grounding and twisting opposing pair cables together for Crosstalk.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/UTPConnectorWiringNetworks.png" alt="Copper Wiring"/></p>
<p>Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP) is the most common, it ends in RJ-45 connectors. Usually used as a medium between an end device to an intermediary device. Twisted pairs mitigate interference, color coding identifies the opposing pairs. Note that twisted pairs are twisted at different rates to avoid interference between them. Follows TIA/EIA 568 and IEEE copper wiring standards.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/CopperConnectorWiringNetworks.png" alt="Copper Wiring Two"/></p>
<p>Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP) has better noise protection than UTP but its expensive and more difficult to install, it ends in RJ-45 connectors. Usually used as a medium between an end device to an intermediary device. Braided shield and individual pair aluminum shield provides EMI and RFI protection. Twisted pairs mitigate interference, color coding identifies the opposing pairs.</p>
<p>Coaxial cable has a woven copper braid that act both as a shield and a second wire in the circuit. It protects the inner copper conductor in a flexible plastic insulator. It ends in BNC, N type or F type connectors. Usually used in wireless installations and wired internet services.</p>
<p><strong>Fiber Optic</strong></p>
<p>More expensive than UTP but ideal for some networking scenarios. Lowest attenuation and completely immune to EMI and RFI. Made from flexible and extremely thin glass strands. uses lasers to encode bits as light pulses. Used in enterprise networks, fiber to the home (FTTH), long distance networks and international submarine cable networks.</p>

<p>Single mode fiber (SMF) has a small core (9 microns) and a glass cladding of 125 microns in diameter, uses expensive lasers and has long distance applications. Multiple mode fiber (MMF) has a larger core (50 to 62.5 microns) and uses low cost lasers or LEDs however because of light scattering MMF has a maximum range of 550 m for a 10 Gbps bandwidth.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless</strong></p>
<p>It uses the air to propagate electromagnetic signals that represent binary digits. This technology provides the best mobility option but it has a limited coverage, is susceptible to interference, it is less secure and its bandwidth is reduced significantly with multiple users. Standards made by the IEEE and the telecom industry cover both the physical and data link layers.</p>

<h1>Numbering System</h1>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/NumberingSystemsBinaryHexNetworks.png" alt="Numbering Systems"/></p>
<p>A binary numbering system is used for IPv4 addresses. Hosts, servers and network devices that use IPv4 identify between themselves by a unique 32 bit string divided into 4 octets (bytes). Generally this binary dotted notation is represented in its decimal format. Another hexadecimal numbering system is used for IPv6 and MAC addresses, it represents a 128 bit string divided into hextets.</p>

<h1>Data Link Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Second Layer</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DataLinkLayerBasicNetworks.png" alt="Second Layer"/></p>
<p>This layer communicates the end devices NIC&#x27;s, it encapsulates Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and IPv6) in Layer 2 data frames, therefore it&#x27;s the gate through which higher level layers are able to access the physical layer. It also performs the first series of error detection to reject corrupted data frames. Depending on the physical medium it will use different IEEE 802 LAN/MAN sublayer standards.</p>
<p>Its main sublayers are the Logical Link Control (LLC 802.2) and the Media Access Control (MAC 802.3, 802.11 or 802.15). The LCC identifies the network protocol used and communicates between the network software and the device hardware. The MAC is responsible for the overall encapsulation, media access control and data link addressing.</p>
<p>The data link layer is mainly responsible for accepting a data frame from the network, exposing the encapsulated packet, re-encapsulating it in a new frame and forwarding the new data frame. There are many organizations that create data link layer standards including: Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), International Organizations for Standardization (ISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</p>
<p><strong>Topologies</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DataLinkLayerTopologiesNetworks.png" alt="Data Link Topologies"/></p>
<p>Physical WAN topologies include: Point to Point (Permanent and Unique Node Link), Hub and Spoke (Central node interconnects branches) and Mesh (High availability but each node needs a connection to every other node). The Hub and Spoke variation called Extended Star topology is widely used since it is easy to install, highly scalable and easy to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Early Ethernet and Legacy Token Ring protocols provided the Bus (Nodes chained together in a line) and Ring (Nodes connected to their neighbors) topologies. WLAN and Legacy Bus (Ethernet Hubs) implemented half duplex communication that only allows one device to send or receive data at a time. Today Ethernet Switches implement full duplex communication that allows both devices to send and receive data at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Access Control Methods</strong></p>
<p>We can divide access control into Containment Based or Controlled Based. In Controlled Based Access every node has its own dedicated time to transmit data, it is a deterministic access used in legacy networks such as Token Rings and ARCNET. In a Containment Based Access every node is operating in half duplex (only one device sends or receives at a time), meaning that they compete for the medium&#x27;s resources.</p>
<p>Examples of Containment Based Access technology include Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mainly used in legacy bus Ethernet LAN&#x27;s or Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance(CSMA/CD) mainly used in IEEE 802.11 WLAN&#x27;s.</p>
<p>CSMA/CD uses a collision detection process by detecting a collision and notifying the rest of the nodes so that the culprits wait a random period of time before they relay the data. CSMA/CA uses a collision avoidance process by including the length of time needed for their transmission while other devices use this information to wait as the network is currently unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Link Header and Trailer</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DataLinkHeaderandTrailerNetworks.png" alt="Header and Trailer"/></p>
<p>In this layer the data is encapsulated with a header and a trailer forming a data frame. The specific header and trailer used and the amount of control information they carry will vary depending on the data link protocol, the access control and the logical topology. The general header and trailer fields are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Field</th><th align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Link Start and Stop</td><td align="center">Identifies the beginning and ending of the link</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Addressing</td><td align="center">Indicates source and destination nodes</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Type</td><td align="center">Identifies the L3 encapsulation protocol</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">Identifies flow control services needed</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Data</td><td align="center">Contains the frame payload</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Error Detection</td><td align="center">Used to determine transmission errors</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Note that this layer uses physical addresses when forwarding data links. The MAC addresses are included in the header and are updated every time a new device forwards the data. In the end the logical topology and network media will determine the data link protocol used: Ethernet, 802.11 Wireless, Point to Point PPP, Frame Relay, High-Level Data Link Control HDLC, etc.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Ethernet Switching</h1>
<p>The Ethernet protocol works at both the physical and the data link layer. It is a family of network technologies defined in 802.2 and 802.3 that create Ethernet data frames. Like other similar data link protocols it uses the LCC and MAC sublayers to work.</p>
<p><strong>Ethernet Frame</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/MACSublayerEthernetFrameNetworks.png" alt="Mac Sublayer"/></p>
<p>The data encapsulation done by the MAC sublayer (802.3) when using Ethernet creates Ethernet frames (internal structure), Ethernet addressing (MAC source and destination) and Ethernet error detection (Frame Check Sequence FCS Trailer). Every Ethernet frame is expected to come from an Ethernet NIC into another Ethernet NIC inside the same LAN.</p>
<p><strong>Topologies and Media Access</strong></p>
<p>The 802.3 MAC sublayer specifies Ethernet standards over various types of media and topologies. Legacy Ethernet uses Bus or Hub topologies (half duplex) with access control via CSMA/CD or contention based access. Today&#x27;s Ethernet Switches in LANs operate in full duplex without access control.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/MACAddressEthernetHeaderNetworks.png" alt="MAC Ethernet"/></p>
<p>An Ethernet MAC address is a 48 bit string expressed as 12 hex digits, since its usually transferred in bytes it can be represented in hex as the range 00 to FF. Leading zeros in the hex pair are always displayed and they are normally prefixed by 0x, suffixed by H or include the subscript 16.</p>
<p>In an Ethernet LAN every device shares the same media and they are differentiated by their MAC at the data link layer. To ensure that every device has a unique MAC every Ethernet NIC manufacturer must register with the IEEE to obtain their starting 24 bit MAC, this string is called the Organization Unique Identifier (OUI).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/FrameProcessingandNICsNetworks.png" alt="Frame Processing"/></p>
<p>When a device forwards data through Ethernet the Frame Header will include the source and destination MACs. When a NIC receives an Ethernet frame it will examine its header to see if it matches its physical MAC address stored in RAM, if it&#x27;s a match it will send the frame to the next OSI layers for decapsulation.</p>
<p><strong>MAC Address Types</strong></p>
<p>Ethernet NICs will also accept frames if the MAC address destination corresponds to a broadcast or multicast group of which the destination is a member. Different MAC addresses are used depending on the communications method (unicast, broadcast, multicast) of the data link layer.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/MACCommunicationsMethodTypeNetworks.png" alt="Communications Method"/></p>
<p>Unicast MACs are unique addresses used when sending a frame from a single device to a single destination. The process used by the source to determine the destination MAC associated with a particular IPv4 address is known as the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and for IPv6 its the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. Note that source MAC addresses must be always unicast MACs.</p>
<p>Broadcast MACs like <code>FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF</code> will send the Ethernet frame to every device on the LAN (broadcast domain) flooding every port of the Ethernet Switch (except the incoming port). This frames won&#x27;t be forwarded by any router in the LAN. Similarly if the encapsulated data is a broadcast IPv4 packet like <code>255.255.255.255</code> in the end it will be sent to every device in the local area network.</p>
<p>Multicast MACs will send the Ethernet frame to a particular multicast group (host group). If the encapsulated data is IPv4 multicast then de MAC address will be <code>01-00-5E</code> and <code>33-33</code> for IPv6 multicast packets. If the data is not IP like in the Spanning Tree Protocol other Multicast MACs may be used. Like in broadcast, unless the devices are configured otherwise, the frame will flood every single port.</p>
<p><strong>MAC Address Table</strong></p>
<p>Every Ethernet Switch has a MAC address table on their data link layer that it uses to forward Ethernet frames. The switch doesn&#x27;t take into account the data or the data protocol (IPv4 ARP packet or IPv6 ND packet) just the Ethernet MAC addresses when forwarding data.</p>
<p>Switches must examine their MAC table for every frame unlike Legacy Ethernet Hubs that forwarded the data on every available port except the incoming port. The table is empty when the switch is powered for the first time and it fills as new devices are connected to it. It is also called the Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/MACAddressTableSwitchesNetworks.png" alt="Frame Filtering"/></p>
<p>Every frame entering an Ethernet Switch is reviewed by examining the source MAC and the incoming port, if this MAC doesn&#x27;t exist it is added to the table with the port number as its ID. If the source MAC was previously added the Switch simply updates the update timer for that entry (most switches keep the entry only for five minutes). By populating this table it will know exactly to which port it must forward the frame (unicast).</p>
<p><strong>Switch Forwarding</strong></p>
<p>The speed and method to forward data depend on the specific devices. Store and Forward Switching is where it receives a frame and ensures its valid, if it passes the CRC check the switch looks at the destination MAC and determines the appropriate exit interface, this decreases frame corruption and bandwidth reduction due to corrupt data. It can be used in QoS analysis for traffic priority frame classification.</p>
<p>Cut Off Switching forwards the frame before being fully received. This method decreases latency but is prone to more frame errors, it can be divided into Fast Forward Switching (Forward as soon as MAC is resolved), where its up to the destination NIC to drop faulty packets, and Fragmentless Switching (First 64 byte check), where it at least ensures that no collision occurred before it forwards the frame.</p>
<p>Frames can be buffered before forwarding or if the destination port is busy due to data congestion. Frame buffering methods include: Port Based Memory where frames are stored in queues bind to individual ports, the frame is transmitted when every previous frame has being successfully transmitted, note that a single frame can delay the whole queue in a port.</p>
<p>In shared based memory ports share a common frame buffer, the memory of the buffers is dynamically allocated and the frames themselves are dynamically bound to their destination ports. This method allows for larger frame transmission with fewer abandoned frames which is important for asymmetric switching (different data rates per port), meaning that some ports can have dedicated bandwidth priority.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DuplexMismatchSwitchesNetworks.png" alt="Duplex Mismatch"/></p>
<p>When switches communicate their port&#x27;s bandwidth (speed) and duplex setting (half or full) must match. The auto-negotiation feature allows the switches to configure their ports. Note that Gigabit Ethernet only works on properly configured full duplex ports. Duplex and crossover mismatch are common causes of performance issues on Ethernet links. Note that direct router-host connections must be done in crossover cables, that is why today most switches support auto media dependent crossover (Auto-MDIX).</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Network Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Third Layer</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/NetworkLayerorIPProtocolNetworks.png" alt="Network Layer"/></p>
<p>The network layer is the communications protocol that allows end devices to exchange data like IPv4 and IPv6. This layer is responsible for terminal addressing, encapsulation, <em>routing</em> and decapsulation. It encapsulates the transport layer segment in IP packets that will be examined by every device in the network.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/NetworkLayerCharacteristicsNetworks.png" alt="Characteristics Network"/></p>
<p>In theory IPs don&#x27;t change continuously like MAC&#x27;s, but due to a recent lack of public IPs the addressing can change via NAT service. IP addressing is intended to have low overhead, meaning that it was designed to work connectionless, minimal or best effort and independent of the media used.</p>
<p>IP is connectionless because it doesn&#x27;t establish any connection before sending the packet, therefore it doesn&#x27;t require any control information (synchronization, confirmation). It assummes that the destination will receive the packet some time in the future. Connection oriented traffic is expected to be handled in the transport layer, usually by TCP.</p>
<p>IP is minimal or best effort since it won&#x27;t guarantee the delivery of the packet and it doesn&#x27;t know the state of the destination device. It is media independent meaning that it sends the data equally through every media (doesn&#x27;t interact with the physical or data link layers). In short it is unreliable, can&#x27;t fix undelivered or corrupt packages and cannot retransmit after failure.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission Unit</strong></p>
<p>This layer stablishes the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) based on the control information sent by the Data Link layer. From this unit IPv4 will determine the MTU size and fragment the packets into smaller units, this processes will inevitably increases latency (for example if the packet goes from Ethernet to a WAN with a smaller MTU), in contrast IPv6 doesn&#x27;t fragment its packets.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/IPV4andIPV6CharactNetworks.png" alt="IPv4 and IPv6"/></p>
<p><strong>IPv4 Packet</strong></p>
<p>The header ensures that the package is sent to the correct destination, contains network layer processing information and its used by every device that needs to handle the packet. It is written in binary, is read from left to right (4 bytes per line) and includes various information fields such as:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Function</th><th align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Version</td><td align="center">For v4 it is the 4 bit string 0100</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Differentiated services</td><td align="center">Used for QoS (DiffServ-DS) or (IntServ - ToS)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Header Checksum</td><td align="center">Detect IPv4 Header Corruption</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Time to Live TTL</td><td align="center">Hop Count. If zero the router drops the packet</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Internet</td><td align="center">Protocol ID for the transport layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Source</td><td align="center">IPv4 32 bit source address</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Destination</td><td align="center">IPv4 32 bit destination address</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><strong>IPv6 Packet</strong></p>
<p>IPv4 has become obsolete because of address depletion (we can&#x27;t assign new addresses), lack of end to end connectivity (private addresses and NAT overhead) and increased complexity (NAT modifies IPs and increases latency). IPv6 was developed to overcome IPv4 limitations with a larger address space (128 bit), improved packet handling (simplified header) and eliminates the need for NAT. IPv6 header is simpler but not smaller (40 Bytes) with fewer fields such as:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Function</th><th align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Version</td><td align="center">For v6 it is the 4 bit string 0110</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Traffic class</td><td align="center">Used for QoS (DiffServ-DS)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Stream Label</td><td align="center">Handle identical stream labels equally (20 bit)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Payload length</td><td align="center">Indicates data length (16 bit)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Next Header</td><td align="center">Protocol ID for the transport layer (TCP, UDP, ICMP)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Hop Limit</td><td align="center">Replaces the hop count TTL</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Source</td><td align="center">IPv4 128 bit source address</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Destination</td><td align="center">IPv4 128 bit destination address</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>IPv6 was also designed to contain extension headers (EH) between the header and the payload, they provide additional network layer information that can be used for security, custom fragmentation, mobility support etc.</p>
<p><strong>Host Routing</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/HostRoutingIPProtocolNetworks.png" alt="Host Routing"/></p>
<p>Packages are created at the source, each host has its own routing table and can send packets to itself <code>127.0.0.1</code> IPv4 or <code>::1</code> IPv6. Local hosts only change their last byte between them but are completely changed when communicating with remote hosts. The source will determine if the destination is local or remote, in IPv4 it will use its own IP, subnet mask and destination IP, in IPv6 it will use the network address and prefix given by the local router.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/DefaultGatewayIPProtocolNetworks.png" alt="Default DGW"/></p>
<p>If the destination is remote the traffic will be disconnected from the host interface to be handled by an intermediary device, if the destination is remote the traffic is forwarded directly to the default gateway router. A network layer switch or router can be configured to be the default gateway (DGW) of a LAN. Default gateways must have an IP in the same range as the rest of the LAN, they can accept LAN data and forward it to other routers (networks).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/RoutingTablesIPProtocolNetworks.png" alt="Routing Tables"/></p>
<p>If a LAN device doesn&#x27;t have a DGW or has configured a wrong DGW it won&#x27;t be able to send data outside the LAN. The source can know its DGW statically or via a DHCP service on IPv4, on IPv6 it can request a router (RS) to be the DGW. Generally DGW routers will be the last entry in the host routing table. To obtain the routing table of a PC in Windows use the command <code>route print</code> or <code>netstat -r</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/RoutingTablesTwoIPProtocolNetworks.png" alt="Routing the Data"/></p>
<p>When the router receives the frame from the host it will use its own routing table to decide how to forward it. As said before if it is a local destination it will use a direct route, added automatically (port identified), if it&#x27;s remote the route will be manual (static), dynamic (shared) or default (no match in the current routing table).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/ShowIPCommandTableRouteNetworks.png" alt="Show IP command"/></p>
<p>The command <code>show ip route</code> displays the route types:</p>
<ul>
<li>L is a route directly connected to a local IP.</li>
<li>C is a direct connection network.</li>
<li>Y is a static route manually configured.</li>
<li>O is an OSPF remote route.</li>
<li>D is an EIGRP remote route.</li>
<li>S or * is the default route.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Subnetting</h2>
<p>Suppose you have a local IP address <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> where the 16 means it has a B class subnet mask <code>255.255.0.0</code> (2 Host bytes). The subnet masks will determine how many bytes of the IP refer to the Host and how many refer to the LAN. Other subnet masks include A <code>255.0.0.0</code> (3 Host bytes) and B <code>255.255.255.0</code> (1 Host bytes). The number of host bytes will determine the number of computers that the LAN can have in its network. Note that two of this IP addresses are already asigned, one is the name of your network <code>192.168.0.0</code> (Network ID) and the other will be the Broadcast IP <code>192.168.255.255</code>.</p>
<p>If you have a particular number of hosts that need to be included in a network ID then you must adjust the subnet mask bits with the power of two that includes that number of hosts. For example if you have the network ID <code>192.168.0.0</code> and need to fit 320 hosts then your subnet maskt will be <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>9</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>512</mn><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>320</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^9 = 512 &gt; 320</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">2</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">9</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em"></span><span class="mord">512</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span><span class="mrel">&gt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em"></span><span class="mord">320</span></span></span></span></span> or <code>255.255.254.0</code> that is equivalent to <code>11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000</code> (9 zeros) represented as <code>192.168.0.0/23</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Address Resolution</h1>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/IP4AddressResolutionNetworks.png" alt="IPv4 Address Res"/></p>
<p>As previously said every device in an Ethernet LAN has a MAC or L2 Physical Address used for NIC to NIC communication and an IP or L3 Logical Address used for sending packets. Address resolution is the process of obtaining a MAC address from a known destination IP. IPv4 uses ARP tables and IPv6 uses ND messages for their MAC to IP mappings.</p>
<p>When sending a frame the device will look up in the ARP table for the destination IPv4 and its corresponding MAC. If the destination IP is in the LAN it will look on its ARP table for the IP and MAC pair, if the destination IP is on another network it will look on its ARP table for the IP and MAC pair of the DGW. If the destination IP isn&#x27;t in the ARP table it will send an ARP request to update the known devices.</p>
<p>ARP table entries are temporary, removed when the ARP cache timer expires or after manual deletion by the admin. ARP requests are sent to every device on the LAN so excessive ARP request could reduce performance. They are also prone to ARP poisoning attacks were a LAN device pretends to be the DGW and sends malicious ARP responses.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/IP6AddressResolutionNetworks.png" alt="IPv6 Address Res"/></p>
<p>IPv6 uses neighbor discovery (ND) and neighbor advertisement (NA) messages for address resolution in device to device communication and it uses router solicitation (RS) and router advertisement (RA) messages for router discovery in device to router communication. For router redirection (next-hop selection) it uses ICMPv6 redirect messages. Note that ICMPv6 needs multicast Ethernet and special IPv6 addresses.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>Router Configuration</h1>
<p>The following are some standard router configuration steps:</p>

<h1>IPv4 Addressing</h1>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/IPANDINGAddressResolutionNetworks.png" alt="ANDing"/></p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are 32 bit hierarchical strings made up of a network and a host portion. The portions are differentiated with the subnet mask in a process called ANDing. Every subnet mask has an associated prefix length (number of bits set to 1). By ANDing the host IP address and the mask we obtain the network IP address back.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Name</th><th align="center">Decimal</th><th align="center">Network Portion</th><th align="center">Host Portion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Subnet Mask</td><td align="center">255.255.255.0</td><td align="center">255.255.255</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Network IP</td><td align="center">192.168.10.0</td><td align="center">192.168.10</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr><td align="center">First IP</td><td align="center">192.168.10.1</td><td align="center">192.168.10</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Last IP</td><td align="center">192.168.10.254</td><td align="center">192.168.10</td><td align="center">254</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Broadcast IP</td><td align="center">192.168.10.255</td><td align="center">192.168.10</td><td align="center">255</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Loopback Local</td><td align="center">127.0.0.0</td><td align="center">127</td><td align="center">0.0.0</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/SubSubnettingNetworks.png" alt="Subnetting"/></p>
<p>When devices connect to a local network they are assigned a valid IP address in a process known as Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). This process is used by DHCP clients to self configure if there are no remote DHCP servers available. Many protocols use broadcast or multicast, for example ARP tables use broadcasts, however note that switches are able to propagate broadcasts but routers cannot. An advantage of subnetting is that we reduce the potential of excessive broadcasts to reduce the network&#x27;s performance. Other reasons for subnetting devices are their location, their function or their type.</p>

<h1>Transport Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Fourth Layer</strong></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/TransportLayerProtocolsNetworks.png" alt="Transport Layer Protocols"/></p>
<p>This layer is responsible for the logical communication between applications on different hosts and acts as the link between application and lower layers. Since the IP protocol doesn&#x27;t specify delivery methods or reliability requirements this layer (via TCP and UDP) will do both by tracking individual conversations using segmentation and multiplexing.</p>

<p><strong>TCP Protocol</strong></p>
<p>TCP is a connection oriented protocol that stablishes a permanent connection (session) between source and target before forwarding information. It is reliable since it confirms received data, retransmits lost or corrupted data as well as sequencing segments that arrive in the wrong order. It also provides flow control by analyzing available resources and slowing data flow speed if necessary to maintain a reliable response.</p>

<p>TCP is generally used for applications that need segmentation, reliability and data flow control such as HTTP, SSH, SMTP and FTP.</p>
<p><strong>UDP Protocol</strong></p>
<p>UDP is a connectionless oriented and best effort protocol where data is rebuilt as it arrives, missing segments aren&#x27;t resent and there is no session providing basic data delivery with little overhead or checking. The client selects a well known source port and a dynamically generated destination port were it will receive back the response from the target.</p>

<p>UDP was designed to be used in minimal data applications (DNS, DHCP), applications where a degree of data loss is acceptable (Streaming, Live Media, VoIP) or where the reliability is handled by the applications themselves (SNMP, TFTP).</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/PairSocketsNetworks.png" alt="Pair Sockets"/></p>
<p><strong>Port Numbers</strong></p>
<p>TCP and UDP use port numbers to handle multiple simultaneous conversations by individual applications. To assign port numbers the transport layer will place a header within the segment that will be encapsulated within an IP packet, this combination of IP and Port is called Socket Pair. Sockets allow for host and process differentiation within the client and the server.</p>
<p>Port numbers can be grouped into three main ranges: Well known ports (0-1023) used for browsers, email, remote access and general connections. Registered ports (1024-49151) are linked to specific processes or applications that the user has installed. Private and Dynamic ports (49152-65635) also known as <em>ephemeral</em> are temporary ports assigned dynamically only for the duration of a particular connection.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/notes/TCPCommunicationProcessNetworks.png" alt="TCP Communication Process"/></p>
<p><strong>TCP Communication Process</strong></p>
<p>Each server application or service must use a unique port number, usually in the dynamic port range, if the application is active then the port is considered open meaning that the transport layer will accept and process segments directed to that port. The TCP communication process can be divided into 7 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source requests a client to server session. From a dynamic to a well known port.</li>
<li>The server acknowledges and requests a server to client session. From a well known to a dynamic port.</li>
<li>The source acknowledges the session and can start sending segments.</li>
<li>The clients sends a segment with an END flag meaning it has finished sending data.</li>
<li>The server responds with an ACK ending the client to server session.</li>
<li>After closing the session the server sends an END flag to the client.</li>
<li>The client responds with an ACK ending the server to client session.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is called three way link communication and it ensures that the target device is present on the network, verifies that the destination has an active service and accepts request on the designated port, informs the target that the source is trying to establish a session on a specific port and ends the connection once communication is complete.</p>

<p>If some segments are lost the TCP protocol can resend all the segments (retransmission) ignoring the duplicates however currently most devices and applications support TCP SACK a technology that allows for selective acknowledgment of the segments received and specification of the segments that need retransmission.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/notes/TCPFlowControlNetworks.png" alt="TCP Flow Control"/></p>
<p>TCP also implements data flow control in the form of window sizes and acknowledgments that slow down data flow speed if the target can&#x27;t reliably acknowledge segments fast enough. To this end TCP assigns each session a Maximum Segment Size (MSS).</p>
<p>MSS is usually calculated by substracting the IP and TCP headers from the Ethernet Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). For example a typical MTU of 1500 bytes will produce a typical IPv4 MSS of 1460 bytes since both headers are 20 bytes each. TCP can prevent router congestion through timers and congestion handling mechanisms.</p>
