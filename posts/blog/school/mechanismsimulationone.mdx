# Kinematics of Mechanisms #

## Definition of Mechanism ##

Kinematics is a subfield of physics describing the motion of points, bodies, and systems *without* considering the forces that cause that movement. Dynamics or kinetics is study of the forces that cause kinematic movement. More specifically kinematics describes position, velocity and acceleration (Speed of a bike) while dynamics describes their forces and interactions (Torque of a motor).

A mechanism is a system of *rigid members* that can move relative to each other by mobile joints creating a kinematic chain and ending in a fixed link. Mechanisms can change between using rotational or linear movement. A machine is a system of mechanisms that transmit and transform the available mechanical energy into the desired motion. A structure is one or more mechanism that have no relative motion between their links as they are designed to carry loads.

## Mechanism Movements ##

**Links and Joints**

A link is a rigid member of a machine or mechanism (including the ground itself), this means that there can't be a change in distance between two arbitrary points of the member. Two or more links can be related with the use of joints form a mechanism. Joints, for example bolts, impose restrictions on the degrees of freedom that one link has relative to another one. 

Minimum number of DoF in a joint that I can have and still consider the system a mechanism is 1, in other words the maximum DoF I can restrict in any joint before being a structure 5.

![Fundamental Kinematic Pairs](/static/images/notes/FundamentalKinematicPairs.jpg)

A kinematic pair is simply a group fundamental joint types and the available DoF they set between two links.

## Degrees of Freedom ##

A degree of freedom is the number of independent coordinates required to ascertain the position of a system or its components, in the real world we have 6 degrees of freedom, 3 translational and 3 rotational. 

**Kutzbach's Criterion**

We use the Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion to find the degrees of freedom or mobility of a whole system as long as the system is made on a 2D analysis and there is no joint that allows its links to have more than 2 DoF available, in other words every joint must restrict at least 4 DoF.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Kutzbach Criterion}
	m = 3(n-1) - 2(j_1) - (j_1)\\
	m = \text{ DoF or Mobility}\\
	j_1 = \text{ Complete joints}\\
	j_2 = \text{ Incomplete joints}
\end{gathered}
$$

A complete joint is one that has 1 DoF available, meaning that the other 5 are restricted. An incomplete joint is one that has 2 or more DoF available. As previously said, the Kutzbach criterion only works for incomplete joints with exactly 2 DoF's available, meaning that the other 4 are restricted. The criterion can't be used if the system has planar or spherical kinematic pairs (3 DoF available)

Knowing the value of $m$ we can infer some things about the system, for example if it has $m=2$ I need to know the movement of at least 2 links before I can determine the final state of the rest of them. In summary to determine the final state of a system I must reduce the mobility of the system to 0 by fixing as many links as necessary. Hiperstatic system have a mobility lower than 0, this means that the system is a structure that has redundant DoF restrictions.

![Kutzbach Examples](/static/images/notes/ExampleKutzbackCriterionMechanismSimulation.png)

From the examples we can see that a joint of three or more links must be considered separately as 2 independent joints, this means that the number of complete joints in a multi-link system is the number of links minus one $j_1=\text{ links}-1$ . One of the main exceptions of the Kutzbach criterion happens when we have three or more parallel links of the same size and everyone has a rotational DoF available.

**Grashof's Law**

![Grashof Examples](/static/images/notes/FourBarLinkKineticMechanismSimulation.png)

This relation applies to 2D 4 link systems where one link is known to be fixed. It states that if the relation is true then at least one link must be able to complete a full turn around its joint, generally the smallest joint. Depending on the link that is fixed we will arrive at different types of motion.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Grashof Law}\\
	s + l \le p + q\\
	s = \text{ Smallest Link Length}\\
	l = \text{ Largest Link Length}\\
\end{gathered}

# Kinematic Analysis #

## Vector Analysis ##

The position of any point P in a given space is the relation it has with respect to the origin or to another reference point. This relation or path can be represented by a vector, for example the vector that goes from the origin O to the point P: $\vec{R_{PO}}$. Note that the speed and rotation of P will always be equal to a linear change in position.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = \vec{R_{PO}} = R^x_{PO}\vec{i} + R^y_{PO}\vec{j} + R^z_{PO}\vec{k}
\end{gathered}
$$


Rotational velocity or acceleration is not defined for a single point but in the case a joint it is defined as the change in angle from a predefined axis, therefore for any arbitrary point inside a link we could measure its angular velocity or acceleration.

**Loop Closure Equation**

For every vector between two points there is an infinite number of equivalent loop closure equations that relate them. Every vector is inherently positive but when broken into its component parts each can either be positive or negative in magnitude. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = \vec{R_{PO}} = R^x_{PO}\vec{i} + R^y_{PO}\vec{j} + R^z_{PO}\vec{k}\\
	P = (R_{PO})(\theta_{PO}) = \vec{R_1} + \vec{R_2} = \vec{R_3} + \vec{R_4} + \vec{R_5} ... = \infty
\end{gathered}
$$

We should define vector loops that correlate to known length measurements so that we can reduce the number of unknown variables in the mechanism. In a 2D plane we represent the angle of a vector using a trigonometric function, generally the cosine with respect to the positive X axis. Note that by using a trigonometric function we are automatically adding the correct sign to the vector's magnitude.

**Euler's Formula First Example**

![Euler Formula Example](/static/images/notes/VectorLoopsEulerMechanismSimulation.png)

Find an expression that determines the position of C given the angle of A.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	m = 3(n-1)-2j_1-j_2 = 3(4-1)-2(4)-0 = 1\\
	\vec{R_1} = \vec{R_2} + \vec{R_3} \land \vec{R_1} = \vec{x} + \vec{y}\\
	\text{Applying Euler's Formula}\\
	e^{j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) \, j\\
	(R_1)(e^{j\theta_1}) = (R_1)((\cos(\theta)) + \sin(\theta) \, j)\\
	(R_1)(e^{j\theta_1}) = (R_2)(e^{j\theta_2}) + (R_3)(e^{j\theta_3})\\
	\vec{x} + \vec{y} = (R_x)(e^{j\theta_x}) + (R_y)(e^{j\theta_y})\\
	\therefore (R_x)(e^{j\theta_x}) + (R_y)(e^{j\theta_y}) = (R_2)(e^{j\theta_2}) + (R_3)(e^{j\theta_3})\\\\
	\text{Real}\\
	(R_x)(\cos(\theta_x)) + (R_y)(\cos(\theta_y)) = (R_2)(\cos(\theta_2)) + (R_3)(\cos(\theta_3))\\ 
	\text{Imaginary}\\
	(R_x)(\sin(\theta_x)) + (R_y)(\sin(\theta_y)) = (R_2)(\sin(\theta_2)) + (R_3)(\sin(\theta_3))\\
	\text{Considering their Angles} \implies \theta_x = 0 \land \theta_y = 90\\
	(R_x)(1) = (R_2)(\cos(\theta_2)) + (R_3)(\cos(\theta_3))\\ 
	(R_y)(1) = (R_2)(\sin(\theta_2)) + (R_3)(\sin(\theta_3))\\
	\text{Unknown Variables} \implies R_x \land \theta_3\\
	\therefore \theta_3 = (\sin^{-1})(\frac{R_y - (R_2)(\sin(\theta_2))}{R_3})\\
	\therefore R_x = (R_2)(\cos(\theta_2)) + (R_3)(\cos(\theta_3))
\end{gathered}
$$

**Euler's Formula Second Example**

![Euler Formula Second Example](/static/images/notes/VectorLoopsEulerSecondMechanismSimulation.png)

Find an expression that determines the position of C and the angle of the second link given the angle of B.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\vec{R_2} = \vec{R_1} + \vec{R_4} \land \vec{R_2} = \vec{x} + \vec{y}\\
	\text{Applying Euler's Formula}\\
	e^{j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) \, j\\
	(R_2)(e^{j\theta_2}) = (R_2)((\cos(\theta_2)) + \sin(\theta_2) \, j)\\
	\therefore (R_2)(e^{j\theta_2}) = (R_1)(e^{j\theta_1}) + (R_4)(e^{j\theta_4})\\\\
	\text{Real and Imaginary}\\
	(R_2)(\cos(\theta_2)) = (R_1)(\cos(\theta_1)) + (R_4)(\cos(\theta_4))\\ 
	(R_2)(\sin(\theta_2)) = (R_1)(\sin(\theta_1)) + (R_4)(\sin(\theta_4))\\
	\text{Considering their Angles} \implies \theta_1 = 0\\
	(R_2)(\cos(\theta_2)) = (R_1) + (R_4)(\cos(\theta_4))\\
	(R_2)(\sin(\theta_2)) = (R_4)(\sin(\theta_4))\\\\
	\text{Trigonometric Identity}\\
	\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1\\
	\cos(\theta \pm \alpha) = \cos(\theta)\cos(\alpha) \pm \sin(\theta)\sin(\alpha)\\
	(R_2)^2(\cos^2(\theta_2)) = (R_1)^2 + (2)(R_1)(R_4)(\cos(\theta_4)) + (R_4)^2(\cos^2(\theta_4))\\
	(R_2)^2(\sin^2(\theta_2)) = (R_4)^2(\sin^2(\theta_4))\\\\
	\text{Adding Them Together}\\
	(R_2)^2 = (R_4)^2 + (2)(R_1)(R_4)(\cos(\theta_4)) + (R_1)^2\\
	\therefore R_4 = \pm \sqrt{R_2^2 + (R_1)^2(\cos^2(\theta_4)) - (R_1)^2} - (R_1)(\cos(\theta_4))\\
	\therefore \theta_2 = -(\sin^{-1})(\frac{(R_4)(\sin(\theta_4))}{(R_2)})\\
	\theta_7 = \theta_3 + 120°
\end{gathered}

## Simulation Analysis ##

![Four Link Analysis](/static/images/notes/AnalysisFourLinksMechanismSimulation.png)

For most four link mechanisms you can use an auxiliary vector to find unknown angles, however if we know the angles and we are asked to find the link dimensions then we can directly apply the system of equations without the need of an auxiliary vector. Remember that the analysis will work for angles as long as you have a maximum of two unknown variables.
