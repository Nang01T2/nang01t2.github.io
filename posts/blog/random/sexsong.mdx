The highs and lows of the erotic appear to lack harmony, especially in their unbridled and passionate aura, however I wonder if music can harmonize with this concert. What is the best song to make love? A *sex song* should have very specific qualities, it must be a melody that awakens the libido, that incites the feelings of mutual protection and that it emotionally prepares us to receive the pleasures that unleash in the sexual act. Charles Darwin, in *The Origin of Man* mentions just like the song of birds music probably originated as a tool to attract the attention of the opposite sex. 

Perhaps this is why so many musicians seem to carry an inexplicable sex appeal. An investigation by psychologist Daniel MÃ¼llensiefen delved into this topic interviewing 2000 people about their favorite songs for sex, the most popular choice was Marvin Gaye with his songs: Sexual Healing and Let's Get It On. In short, what better way to explore the creativity and tastes of your significant other than to build a playlist that motivates us to continue enjoying the two great pleasures of humanity.
