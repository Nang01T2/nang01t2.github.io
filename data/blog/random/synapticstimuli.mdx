Synaptic Stimuli[^1] is an art website dedicated to sharing the artworks of contemporary artists. This virtual gallery houses exceptionally creative works that are not afraid to experiment with unique designs, aimed at representing the abstract dimension of human consciousness.

> Art is a transmission of consciousness.

The project, created in 2009, is led by the photographer and artist [Michel Chichi](https://michael.persona.co/). The entire project is funded through donations.

> A meme is a parcel of cultural meaning, a shared value, the Trojan horse of a worldview. The transmission of a meme often occurs through iconography. The journey of the visual meme through the cultural body presents an icon vector, the trail of an image through time and the collective mind. Art is a tool of evolutionary consciousness due to its ability to transmit memes.

Synaptic Stimuli is part of a Network of Sites[^2] that share the goal of distributing art. The site itself uses a template designed by the *Cargo Collective*[^3] a group of Open Source developers who are dedicated to designing blogging platforms[^4] for artists. The idea for this business model came when Cargo finished designing the site for [Space Collective](http://spacecollective.org/).
