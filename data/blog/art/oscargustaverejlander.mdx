* British photographer who helped create the notion of photography as art (1813 - 1875). 
* His work is focused on portraits and the use of light as a way of "painting" in photography. 
* His masterpiece *Two Ways of Life* shows great care in the scene, positions, clothing, place, light and editing.
* It required thirty negatives and six weeks to produce, but it was so famous that Queen Victoria bought a copy for Prince Albert.
* He promoted the importance of photography with the first documentary photography showing the life of English men.
* He also illustrated some of Charles Darwin drawings. 
* Shortly after his death his edition techniques were forgotten with the arrival of the authentic school of photography.
* This school of art didn't admitted any editions since they argue it meant losing the photograph authenticity.
