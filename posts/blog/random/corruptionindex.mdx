The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is an index that scores countries based on their perceived level of government corruption since 1995. Published annually by Transparency International, an organization dedicated to combat fraud and bribery in the public sector. The score ranges from 0 (max) to 100 (min) from approximately 15 datasets. Corruption measured by the CPI weakens economies when they rely heavily on public services. 

Transparency International was founded in 1993 by Peter Eigen, retired World Bank official. Mexico does not seems to not enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery or the UN Arms Trade Treaty. The branch of TI in Mexico is *Transparencia Mexicana* (TM). Mexico needs to strengthen its *Auditoría Superior de la Federación* and its *Instituto Nacional de Acceso a la Informacion*.

# Corruption #

Corruption has been around for a very long time and will continue unless governments figure out effective ways to combat it. Governments maneuver themselves into a monopoly to be bribed for licenses, approved expenditure or imports across their borders. There is a statistical relation between a country's poor wealth and a higher level of corruption.

* Since much of the corruption is traced to government intervention, policies to privatization and deregulation can reduce corruption.
	* Trade restrictions, importers will bribe officials and local monopolies will bribe to maintain the regulations.
	* Government subsidies that are poorly targeted, industries bribe to get the subsidies where they should not belong.
	* Price control to lower the price of a good, bribes to acquire an unfair market share of high volume selling.
	* Multiple money exchange rates for different sectors, bribes to obtain the most advantageous rate.
	* Low wages relative to the private sector are a source of low level corruption. 
	* Natural resource extraction bribes, since they can be sold at a higher price and the incriminating cost is low.
	* Sociological and cultural factors, ethnolinguistic divisions and strong family ties related to higher corruption.

* There are many effects that corruption bring to a country's economy:
	* The main factor is that corruption is viewed by investors like an unofficial form of tax, slowing startup creation.
	* If corruption practices are extremely lucrative a portion of highly talented people will shift their efforts.
	* International aid flow reduction since donors know their resources are not being allocated properly.
	* It can reduce the tax revenue from every industry in the private sector.
	* Allocation of public contracts in a corrupt system leads to lower quality infrastructure.
	* Large projects with a difficult value to monitor are lucrative opportunities to get extorting bribes.
