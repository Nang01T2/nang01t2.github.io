# Basic Concepts #

* Security is freedom from or resilience against potential harm caused by others.
* Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers and electronic systems from malicious attacks, also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
* The most common attack for password access is social engineering.

## Types of Cybersecurity ##

* Application: Prevent data and code used by a business from being stolen or hijacked with penetration testing and encryption.
* Information: Prevent physical and digital data from unathorized access and manipulation, on site and remote systems.
* Infrastructure: Make sure that structures and facilities such as the electrical grid, data centers are access controlled
* Network security: Secure internal computer networks agains unauthorized access with tools like remote access management and 2FA
* Users Education: Teach every employee and customer for recognizing and avoiding malware and phishing.

Cybersecurity is important since it protects data from theft and damage, including sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), health information (PHI), intellectual property and govermental and industry systems. Attackers are no longer enthusiast but fully organized crime groups. In 2021 3.5 million positions go unfulfilled globally.

The average cost of remediating a ransomware have gone to 1.85 million (2021) from downtime, lost orders, operational costs, the ransom on crytocoins average only costs a tenth of the losses. The number of organizations that paid the ransom is also increasing to 32 percent (2021) even if less than 10 percent of the ones that pay recover all of their data. The Mexican Law of Cybersecurity is included in 211 of Codigo Penal Federal, the nation has a national guard cybercrime unit, federal law dictates personal data protection and the official cost of cyberattacks is valued at 7.7 billion dollars (2017). Sadly Mexico is the greatest producer of cp.

Assets are something of value to a person, business or organization. IT assets are any element used in to add value to the organization such as software (DBMS, Office, OS, Apps), hardware (Servers, routers, switches, IoT, Appliances, HVAC, PSU), data (Domains, customers, personnel, finances, code, industrial secrets) or other (public image, credibility). 

* Threats: Something that could cause harm to a system or organization.
* Vulnerability: Flaw or weakness that can be used to attack.
* Exploit: Attack on a computer system that takes advantage of a particular vulnerability in the operating system, application or any software code.

Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) are the pillars of modern cybersecurity and good security systems. This must be taken into account on Process level (management systems, governance, policies, 3rd party management), Data level (IT, OT, Personal Data, Operational Data) and on a People level (Training, awareness, skills, qualifications, authorization and physical security).

* Confidentiality: Component associated with secrecy and the use of encryption, data must be available only to authorized agents. If information is confidential then it hasn't been compromised by other parties, data can't be disclosed to people who do not require them or should not have access to them. Information is organized in a way that only the person that needs the information can have access. Breaches are commonly through hacking or social engineering. Hashes are the most common way of encryption (one way functions).
* Integrity: Data integrity refers to the certainty that data won't be tampered or degraded during or after submission. Data must be keept secure from unauthorized modification even if unintentional. Data could be compromised mainly during upload or transmission or during storage in a database.
* Availability: Information is available to authorized users, done by having properly functioning systems, security controls and communication channels. Critical systems (power generation, medical equipment, safety devices) often have extreme availability requirements (cyber threats, power outagaes, hardware failures and other events).

Cybersecurity Attributes

* Authenticity: Property of data or system of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted in transmission, data and storage.
* Nonrepudiation: Property of data or system of assurance that another agent can't deny you authenticity, nonrepudiation is the ability to ensure that communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or message.
* Privacy: Property of data or system that assured that an individual can control or influence data related to them from being collected and stored by others.

Cybersecurity is the prevention of damage to, protecion of and restoration of computers, electronic systems and information contained therein to ensure availability, integrity, confidentiality, authentication and nonrepudiation. It is a subset of information technology security using CIA for asset protection of cyber and physical systems. Today both terms are used interchangeably.

# Threat #

Cyber threat intelligence is information about threats and threat actors that mitigate harmful events, sources include open source, social media, humans, technical and deep web.

* Threat: Active entity that can cause damage to a person or organization, also called adversarial as they oppose the business objectives. It can be natural or human, human threats can be intentional or unintentional, intentional human threats can be random or targeted.
* Actors: Cyber threat actors are states, groups, individuals with malicious intent aim to take advantage of vulnerabilities, low security awareness and technological developments to gain unauthorized access affecting data, devices, systems and networks.

Actors of Cyberthreats

* Nation States with geopolitical motivation
* Cybercriminals with profit motives
* Hacktivists with ideological motives
* Terrorist Groups with ideological violence
* Thrill seekers with satisfaction motives
* Insider Threats with discontent

Types of common security risks or cybersecurity threats

* Malware: Generic term for any malicious software designed to harm or exploit programmable devices, systems or networks. Malware infects a computer and changes how it functions, destroys data or spies on the user, it can spread from one device to another or remain in place only impacting its host.
* Virus: Usually coming as an attachment in an email holding a payload or a malware that will perform a malicious action once the file is opened by the user. For example NATAS, it infected random software, one of the first virus that could replicate.
* Ransomware: Malware that installs itself onto a victim's machine, encrypts their files and demands a ransom to return the data to the user.
* Scareware: Scaring users into thinking that a system has been compromised to convince victims into purchasing a fake solution, it has an important component of social engineering since it sells the solution to a fake problem.
* Worms: Malware designed to copy themselves from device to device as quickly as posible through a security weakness that don't require user interaction.
* Spyware: Malware installed on your computer, usually without your explicit knowledge that captures and transmits personal information and browsing habits to its user, it's designed to monitor every form of communication on the target device.
* Trojans: Malware that camouflages as a harmless application, once up and running they can steal data, crash the device, spy or launch an attack.
* Adware: Usually installed with other harmless programs with unwanted advertisements at users with pop up windows so that the user performs a certain action.
* Phishing: Attack occurs when sending email from seemingly trusted sources in an attempt to grab sensitive information, they combine social engineering and technology. 
* Spear Phishing: Specific type of targeted phishing attack custom made for a particular target, usually uses email spoofing where the information inside the from portion of the email is faked making it look like the email comes from a different sender.
* Man in the Middle (MITM): Attack or breach designed to eavesdrop on the data sent between two people, networks or devices. The attacker positions themselves in the middle of communications, effectively spying on the interaction between systems where there could be less security.
* Distributed Denial of Service DOS or DDOS: Attack designed to overwhelm the resources of a system where it is unable to reply to legitimate service requests, a distributed attack also seeks to drain resources of a system initiated by a vast array of malware infected host machines. The victim is unable to provide the service to its users.
* Backdoor: Point of entry into a user system or computer that bypasses authentication measures, encryption or intrusion detection. With a remote access they can steal information, install further malware or control the processes. Legitimate backdoors are used by software for troubleshooting, updates and maintenance.
* Bots and Botnets: A bot or zombie is an internet connected device that is infected with malware without the owners awareness and can be remotely controled to perform a malicous task. A botnet is an array of bots to perform the same action multiple times.
* Rootkit: Malware to provide a remote actor with a privileged user access, and therefore full control of the device to further modify the software.
* SQL Injection
* Zero Day Explot
* DNS Attack

# Cryptography #

* Symmetric Cryptography: Also known as private-key, single-key or secret-key. One to one communication can be intercepted by a middle man from an unsecure channel, the objective is to encrypt the information so that only the authorized parties are able to understand the information. It works by passing the message in plaintext (x) through an encryption function (e) to generate ciphertext (y), the function (e) uses a random Key Generator (K) through a secure channel that is shared with a decryption function (d), using this the attacker would need to intercept the ciphertext (y) and the more much difficult to obtain Key (K).
