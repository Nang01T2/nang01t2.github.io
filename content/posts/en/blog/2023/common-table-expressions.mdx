## Introduction
I had to migrate some data from SQL Server for a new feature in my project. I wrote a script that can handle complex and reusable queries. I also used CTE (Common Table Expression) to make my code easier to read and maintain. In this post, I will show you what CTE is and how to use it.

## CTE in sql server
CTE stands for common table expression, which is a temporary result set that you can use in a statement like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`. CTEs help you structure your code better and let you perform multi-level aggregations on your data, such as finding the average of a group of counts.

## CTE benefits 
- CTEs improve the readability of code. And readable code makes debugging queries simplier.
- CTEs allow you to use the results multiple times in the query. By saving the results of the subquery, you can use them again in a bigger query.
- CTEs can help you do multi-level aggregations. Use CTEs to save the results of aggregations, which you can then use in the main query.

## CTE syntax
To create a CTE, you use the `WITH` keyword and a variable name that acts as a temporary table that you can use in other parts of your query.

The following shows the common syntax of a CTE in SQL Server:
```sql
WITH cte_name[(column_name [,...])]
AS
    (CTE_definition)
SQL_statement;
```

In this syntax:
- First, given a name the cte `cte_name` that you can use later in a query.
- Next, you can optionally list the columns after the cte_name, separated by commas. The columns must have the same number as the columns in the `CTE_definition`.
- Then, after the cte name or the column list (if you have one), use the `AS` keyword.
- After, define a `SELECT` statement whose result set populates the common table expression.
- Finally, refer to the common table expression in a query (`SQL_statement`) such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`.

## CTE example

Let's see some examples of how to use common table expressions.

### Basic CTE example

This query uses a CTE that shows the sales amounts of each sales staff in 2023:

```sql
WITH cte_sales_amounts (staff, sales, year) 
AS (
    SELECT    
        first_name + ' ' + last_name, 
        SUM(quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)),
        YEAR(order_date)
    FROM orders o
      INNER JOIN order_items i ON i.order_id = o.order_id
      INNER JOIN staffs s ON s.staff_id = o.staff_id
    GROUP BY 
        first_name + ' ' + last_name,
        year(order_date)
)

SELECT
    staff, 
    sales
FROM 
    cte_sales_amounts
WHERE
    year = 2023;
```

In this example:
- First, we define a CTE named cte_sales_amounts which returns a result set that consists of three columns `staff`, `sales`, and `year`
- Then, we constructed a query that gets the sum of sales by sales staff and year from the `orders`, `order_items` and `staffs` tables.
- Finally, we referred to the CTE in the main query and selected only the rows whose years are 2023.

### Using a CTE to calculate report averages from counts

This example uses the CTE to calculate the mean number of sales orders in 2023 for all sales staffs.

```sql
WITH cte_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        staff_id, 
        COUNT(*) order_count  
    FROM
        orders
    WHERE 
        YEAR(order_date) = 2023
    GROUP BY
        staff_id

)
SELECT
    AVG(order_count) average_orders_by_staff
FROM 
    cte_sales;
```

### Using more than one CTE in a single query example
The following example gets the product count and sales amount for each product category; we use two CTEs: `cte_category_counts` and `cte_category_sales`. These CTEs are joined by the category_id column in the main query.

```sql
WITH cte_category_counts (
    category_id, 
    category_name, 
    product_count
)
AS (
    SELECT 
        c.category_id, 
        c.category_name, 
        COUNT(p.product_id)
    FROM products p
        INNER JOIN categories c ON c.category_id = p.category_id
    GROUP BY 
        c.category_id, 
        c.category_name
),
cte_category_sales(category_id, sales) AS (
    SELECT    
        p.category_id, 
        SUM(i.quantity * i.list_price * (1 - i.discount))
    FROM order_items i
        INNER JOIN products p ON p.product_id = i.product_id
        INNER JOIN sales.orders o ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    WHERE order_status = 4 -- completed
    GROUP BY 
        p.category_id
) 

SELECT 
    c.category_id, 
    c.category_name, 
    c.product_count, 
    s.sales
FROM
    cte_category_counts c
    INNER JOIN cte_category_sales s 
        ON s.category_id = c.category_id
ORDER BY 
    c.category_name;
```
