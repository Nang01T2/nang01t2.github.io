* Born in Savannah Georgia, Gordon suffered as a child from constant accidents and illnesses that weakened her hearing. 
* She used her free time to develop her artistic skills, starting the local newspaper *The Malbone Bouquet* with her cousins.
* After the death of her husband William Mackay Low, she started traveling and in 1911 meet Robert Baden.
* Inspired by the Boys Scouts with 40,000 members at the time, she decides to form an analogous group called the Girl Guides.
