* Belgian painter in the early Renaissance period (1466 - 1530).
* Founder of the Antwerp school in Belgium. He was a blacksmith before studying the arts. His work focused on religion and satire.
* We don't have many records of him, however we know that his artistic profession wasn't born out of economic necessity.
* We assume based on his style that he took many trips to Italy and other parts of Europe to obtain inspiration and further education.
