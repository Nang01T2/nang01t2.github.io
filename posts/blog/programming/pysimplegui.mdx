# PySimpleGUI Debugger #

The module includes the python debugger `imwatchingyou` a great little app that allows you to see and interact with your code while running. Use the `Break` or `Ctrl + Break` to open the debugger, by default it will show current events and their values. To run the debugger we need to add a timeout to any reads:

```python
# Blocking Reading Call
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
# Non Blocking Reading Call
while True:
    event, values = window.read(timeout=200)
    if event == sg.TIMEOUT_KEY:
        continue
```

We need the timeout since the debugger steals a little bit of time from these read async calls, but only while the debugger is open. The value of 200 means that the debugger will update 5 times per second if the application is idle. If you don't want to add a timeout you could also add a button that causes the main loop to execute again, the debugger will use the manual execution to update.

```python
# Program to test the debugger
import PySimpleGUI as sg

window = sg.Window('Testing the Debugger', [[sg.Text('Debugger Tester'), sg.In('Input here'), sg.B('Push Me')]])

while True:
    event, values = window.read(timeout=500)
    if event == sg.TIMEOUT_KEY:
        continue
    if event == sg.WIN_CLOSED:
        break
    print(event, values)
window.close()
```

The Popout debugger window display as many current local scope variables as possible and isn't interactive. 



```python


One "variable" shown in the popout window that is an often asked for piece of information when debugging Issues and that variable is sg (or whatever you named the PySimpleGUI pacakge when you did your import). The assumption is that your import is import PySimpleGUI as sg. If your import is different, then you'll see a different variable. The point is that it's shown here.

Exiting this window is done via the little red X, or using the rickt-click menu which is also used as one way to launch the Main Debugger Window

Ways of Launching the Popout Window
There are 3 ways of opening the Popout window.

Press the BREAK key on your keyboard.
Call the function show_debugger_popout_window(location=(x,y))
Add Debug() button to your layout - adds a little purple and yellow PySimpleGUI logo to your window
When you are asked for the "Location of your PySimpleGUI package or PySimpleGUI.py file" do this
If you wish to use the debugger to find the location of THIS running program's PySimpleGUI package / the PySimpleGUI.py file, then all you need to do is: * Press the BREAK key on your keyboard. * This is sometimes labelled as the Cancel key * May also have Pause printed on key * On some US keyboards, it is located next to Scroll Lock and/or above PageUp key * This will open a window located in the upper right corner of your screen that looks something like this: image * The information you are seeking is shown next to the sg in the window You don't need to modify your program to get this info using this technique.

If your variable's value is too long and doesn't fit, then you'lll need to collect this information using the "Main Debugger Window"

What's NOT Listed In The Popout Debugger Window
The Popup window is a "Snapshot" of your local variables at the time the window was opened. This means any variables that did not exist at the time the Popout was created will not be shown. This window does NOT expand in size by adding new variables. Maybe in the future.

The "Main Debugger Window"
Now we're talking serious Python debugging!

Ever wish you had a repl>>> prompt that you could run while your program is running. Well, that's pretty much what you're getting with the PySimpleGUI debugger Main Window! Cool, huh? If you're not impressed, go get a cup of coffee and walk off that distraction in your head before carring on because we're in to some seriously cool shit here....

You'll find that this window has 2 tabs, one is labelled Variables and the other is labelled REPL & Watches

Ways of Opening the Main Debugger Window
There are 3 ways to open the Main Debugger Window

Press Control + Break on your PC keyboard
From the Popout Debug Window, right click and choose Debugger from the right click menu
From your code call show_debugger_window(location=(x,y))
The "Variables" Tab of Main Debugger Window
SNAG-0440

Notice the the "frame" surrounding this window is labelled "Auto Watches" in blue. Like the Popup window, this debugger window also "Watches" variables, which means continuously updates them as often as you call Window.read.

The maximum number of "watches" you can have any any one time is 9.

Choosing variables to watch
You can simply click "Show All Variable" button and the list of watched variables will be automatically populard by the first 9 variables it finds. Or you can click the "Choose Variables to Auto Watch" button where you can individually choose what variables, and expressions you wish to display.

SNAG-0442

In this window we're checking checkboxes to display these variables:

event, sg, values, window, __file__

SNAG-0443

Additionally, you can see at the bottom of the window a "Custom Watch" has been defined. This can be any experession you want. Let's say you have a window with a LOT of values. Rather than looking through the values variable and finding the entry with the key you are looking for, the values variable's entry for a specific key is displayed.

In this example the Custom Watch entered was values[0]. After clicking on the "OK" button, indicating the variables are chosen that we wish to watch, this is the Main window that is shown:

SNAG-0444

We can see the variables we checked as well as the defined expression values[0]. If you leave this window open, these values with continuously be updated, on the fly, every time we call the line in our example code window.read(timeout=500). This means that the Main Debugger Window and these variables we defined will be updated every 500 milliseconds.

The REPL & Watches Tab
SNAG-0441

This tab is provided to you as a way to interact with your running program on a real-time basis.

If you want to quickly look at the values of variables, nearly ANY variables, then type the information into one of the 3 spaces provided to "Watch" either variables or experessions. In this example, the variable window was typed into the first slow.

Immediately after typing the character 'w', the information to the right was displayed. No button needs to be clicked. You merely neeed to type in a valid experession and it will be displayed to you.... and it will be displayed on an on-going, constantly-refreshing-basis.

SNAG-0447

If the area to the right of the input field is too small, then you can click on the "Detail" button and you will be shown a popup, scrolled window with all of the information displayed as if it were printed.

I'm sure you've had the lovely experience of printing an object. When clicking the "Detail" button next to the window variable being shown, this window is shown:

SNAG-0449

Oh, Python, -sigh-. I just want to see my window object printed.

Obj Button to the Rescue!
PySimpleGUI has a fun and very useful function that is discussed in the docs named ObjToString which takes an object and converts it's contents it into a nicely formatted string. This function is used to create the text output when you click the Obj button. The result is this instead of the tiny window shown previously:

SNAG-0446

The REPL Prompt
While not really a Python REPL prompt, this window's REPL >>> prompt is meant to act as much like one as possible. Here you can enter experessions and code too.

The uses for this prompt are so numerous and diverse that listing them all won't be attempted.

Your "XRay" and "Endoscope" into Your Program
Think of this prompt as a way to get specific diagnostics information about your running program. It cannot be stressed enough that the power and the usefullness of this tool is in its ability to diagnose a running program, after you've already started it running.

Execute Code
In addition to displaying information, getting paths to packages, finding version information, you can execute code from the PySimpleGUI Debugger's REPL >>> prompt. You can type in any expression as well as any executable statement.

For example, want to see what PopupError looks like while you're running your program. From the REPL prompt, type: sg.PopupError('This is an error popup')

The result is that you are shown a popup window with the text you supplied.

KNOW Answers to Questions About Your Program
Using this runtime tool, you can be confident in the data you collect. Right?

There's no better way to find what version of a package that your program is using than to ask your program. This is so true. Think about it. Rather than go into PyCharm, look at your project's "Virtual Environment", follow some path to get to a window that lists packages installed for that project, get the verstion and your're done, right? Well, maybe. But are you CERTAIN your program is using THAT version of the package in question?

SO MUCH time has been wasted in the past when people KNEW, for sure, what version they were running. Or, they had NO CLUE what version, or no clue to find out. There's nothing wrong with not knowing how to do something. We ALL start there. Geeez..

A real world example.....

How To Use the Debugger to Find The Version Number of a Package
Let's pull together everything we've learned to now and use the debugger to solve a problem that happens often and sometimes it's not at all obvious how to find the answer.

We're using Matplotlib and want to find the "Version".

For this example, the little 12-line program in the section "A Sample Program For Us To Use" is being used.

That program does not import matplotlib. We have a couple of choices, we can change the code, we can can import the package from the debugger. Let's use the debgger.

Pull up the Main Debugger Window by pressing CONTROL+BREAK keys. Then click the "REPL * Watches" tab. At the >>> prompt we'll first import the package by typing: import matplotlib as m

The result returned from Python calls that don't return anything is the value None. You will see the command you entered in the output area followed by "None", indicating success.

finally, type: m.__version__

The entire set of operations is shown in this window:

SNAG-0448

By convention you'll find many modules have a variable __version__ that has the package's version number. PySimpleGUI has one. As you can see matplotlib has one. The requests module has this variable.

For maximum compatibility, PySimpleGUI not only uses __version__, but also has the version contained in another variable version which has the version number because in some situations the __version__ is not available but the version variable is avaiable.

It is recommended that you use the variable version to get the PySimpleGUI version as it's so far been the most successful method.

tkinter, however does NOT.... of course.... follow this convention. No, to get the tkinter version, you need to look at the variable: TkVersion

Here's the output from the REPL in the debugger showing the tkinter version:

>>> import tkinter as t
None
>>> t.TkVersion
8.6
>>> t.__version__
Exception module 'tkinter' has no attribute '__version__'
```


# User Settings API #

User settings are basically a python dictionary that is written to your hard drive, later to be parsed as JSON. Since it is a dictionary we consider individual settings as keys. Reading or writing to the file will save it automatically. You can interface with the file by using user settings function calls or by using the `UserSettings` class. Function calls: 

| Function | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| user_settings_filename | Returns path and filename of settings file (File) |
| user_settings | Returns current settings as a dictionary (File) |
| user_settings_set_entry | Sets an entry to a particular value (Setting) |
| user_settings_get_entry | Returns value for a setting. If not returns default value (Setting) |
| user_settings_delete_entry | Deletes a setting (Setting) |
| user_settings_delete_filename | Deletes the settings file (File) |
| user_settings_file_exists | Returns True if the file exists (File) |
| user_settings_write_new_dictionary | Writes a dict to a new settings file (File) |
| user_settings_load | Loads the settings file. Not normally needed (File) |
| user_settings_save | Saves settings to file. Not normally needed (File) |

Note that the settings filename defaults to the filename of you Python file with the extension `json` added with the default path in Windows: `\user\user_name\AppData\Local\PySimpleGUI\settings`. You can modify the default Filename, Path or Both by using `sg.user_settings_filename(filename='my_settings.json', path='.')`.

Using the `UserSettings` class is like working with a Python dictionary. The first step is to create a settings object;

```python
# Create settings object
settings = sg.UserSettings()
# Or use the call user_settings_filename()
# Read a settings value
item_value = settings['-item-']
# Write a settings value
settings['-item-'] = new_value
# Delete a settings value
del settings['-item-']
# Another way of deleting a value
settings.delete_entry('-item-')
# If not found return '' instead of None
value = settings.get('-item-', '')
# Set a global default value
settings.set_default_value(new_default)
# Print the dictionary
settings.load()
print(settings)
# Another way of printing the dict
print(sg.user_settings())
```

Since user settings aren't critical for the GUI operation its errors, usually related to bad paths or write permissions, are considered soft errors that won't crash the application.

```python
# Bad user settings path generates an error
def main():
    sg.user_settings_filename(path='...')
    sg.user_settings_set_entry('-test-',123)
# Silcence user settings errors
sg.user_settings_silent_on_error()
```

The convention with user settings is to use upper case for normal key strings and lower case for user settings strings. User settings are values that are meant to be saved so that they can be remembered and generated later on. One common use is for remembering a recently used system path:

```python
# Typical file input row
[sg.Input(key='-IN-'), sg.FileBrowse()]
# Fill in using the last known user setting
[sg.Input(sg.user_settings_get_entry('-filename-', ''), key='-IN-'), sg.FileBrowse()]
# Set the user setting anywhere in the loop
sg.user_settings_set_entry('-filename-', values['-IN-'])
```

For example:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
layout = [[sg.Text('Enter a filename:')],
          [sg.Input(sg.user_settings_get_entry('-filename-', ''), key='-IN-'), sg.FileBrowse()],
          [sg.B('Save'), sg.B('Exit Without Saving', key='Exit')]]
window = sg.Window('Filename Example', layout)
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event in (sg.WINDOW_CLOSED, 'Exit'):
        break
    elif event == 'Save':
        sg.user_settings_set_entry('-filename-', values['-IN-'])
window.close()
```

You could write the previous example using the `UserSettings` class and the brackets syntax:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
settings = sg.UserSettings()
layout = [[sg.Text('Enter a filename:')],
          [sg.Input(settings.get('-filename-', ''), key='-IN-'), sg.FileBrowse()],
          [sg.B('Save'), sg.B('Exit Without Saving', key='Exit')]]
window = sg.Window('Filename Example', layout)
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    if event in (sg.WINDOW_CLOSED, 'Exit'):
        break
    elif event == 'Save':
        settings['-filename-'] = values['-IN-']
window.close()
```

If you have an extensive user settings file you can use `user_settings_write_new_dictionary(dict)` to use a python dictionary to set the default values of your settings file, this prevents an accidental overwrite of your values.

# Extending the Module #

By design the module was build for quick GUI prototyping and therefore doesn't include every tkinter setting, however you can extend its functionality for your particular edge case. Most of this edge cases are at the *element* level, meaning that if you need an element to do something outside of the API we recommend that you modify the `Element.Widget` class variable. Note that you must `Read` or `Finalize` the window before accessing the widget directly. You can do this by adding the `finalize` parameter to the `Window` call.

```python
window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout, finalize=True)
```

In one example case a user wanted to disable the focus property that happened on their custom-made button when changing tabs. There is a way to disable focus in PySimpleGUI but it is global, fortunately we can use the `Widget` class variable to specify the properties of that particular element.

```python
window[button_key].Widget.config(takefocus=0)
```

This is how you can access most of tkinter element options without the need of importing tkinter itself, the only thing you will need is the widget's type. To get the type of a widget you have implemented you can use its key and call:

```python
print(type(window[your_element_key].Widget))
```

# Tkinter Binding #

At this moment there is no direct access to the window as a class variable, but you can access a similar root object called `sg.Window.TKroot`. Also you can skip PySimpleGUI and receive tkinter events directly via `Window.read()`. To do so you will use the `bind` method included in Elements and Windows. This method needs a string with the events to bind and a key modifier. 

If your element's key is a string then it will be appended, if not then it will be returned separately as a tuple. We provide the member variable `user_bind_event` containing information that tkinter generated from user bindings.

```python
# Direct bind of an event to an element
window['-KEY-'].bind('<TKINTER EVENT>', 'STRING TO APPEND')
# Direct bind of an event to the window
window.bind('<TKINTER EVENT>', 'STRING TO APPEND')
# To unbind simply use the unbind method.
window['-KEY-'].unbind('TKINTER EVENT')
```

* [Tkinter Bind Events](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6.11/TkCmd/bind.html)

For example:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
sg.theme('Dark Green 2')
layout = [  [sg.Text('Custom Binding Example')], [sg.Input(key='-IN1-')], 
		[sg.Input(key='-IN2-')], 
		[sg.Button('Go'), sg.Button('Unbind'), sg.Button('Exit')] ]
window = sg.Window('Window Title', layout, finalize=True)
window.bind("<Button-1>", 'Window Click')
window['Go'].bind("<Button-3>", ' +RIGHT CLICK+')
window['-IN2-'].bind("<FocusIn>", ' +FOCUS+')
while True:
	event, values = window.read()
	print(event, values)
	if event in (sg.WIN_CLOSED, 'Exit'):
		break
	if event == 'Unbind':
		window['Go'].unbind('<Button-3>')
window.close()
```

# Demo Programs #

Use the [hundreds of sample programs](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms) to jumpstart your app and understand specific integration solutions with other python modules. You can also find a lot of them in [Trinket](http://Trinket.PySimpleGUI.org).

# Creating an EXE #

You can create a single executable without the need of a python distribution.

```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI
pip install PyInstaller
pyinstaller -wF my_program.py
```

If you get the error `script '\src\tkinter' not found` try adding `--hidden-import tkinter` to your command. When debugging you can use the high level API function `sg.Print()`, by doing `print = sg.Print` at the start of your script you are routing your `stdout` and `stderror` to a scrollable window instead of the terminal.

# Look And Feel #

Change the look and feel of your app by calling `sg.ChangeLookAndFeel(LookAndFeelValue)` were the valid Look and Feel values can be generated by calling `ListOfLookAndFeelValues()`. What this function actually does is set a bunch of color theme values using `Set Options`: 

```python
SetOptions(background_color=colors['BACKGROUND'], text_element_background_color=colors['BACKGROUND'], element_background_color=colors['BACKGROUND'], text_color=colors['TEXT'], input_elements_background_color=colors['INPUT'], button_color=colors['BUTTON'], progress_meter_color=colors['PROGRESS'], border_width=colors['BORDER'], slider_border_width=colors['SLIDER_DEPTH'], progress_meter_border_depth=colors['PROGRESS_DEPTH'], scrollbar_color=(colors['SCROLL']), element_text_color=colors['TEXT'], input_text_color=colors['TEXT_INPUT'])
```

As one last tip is to call `sg.ObjToSting(Object)` when working with deeply nested objects to generate a nicely formatted representation.
