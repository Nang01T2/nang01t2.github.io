Lynx is one of the oldest web browsers, it allows us to use de internet with a text based interface. Since it doesn't load any images or scripts it's exceptionally fast. Originally developed by Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe, and Charles Rezac at the University of Kansas (1992) and currently maintained by Thomas Dickey. One of its modern uses is to determine any crawling problems on a website. While investigating the browser I came across [this](http://world.std.com/~adamg/manifesto.html) funny manifest, here is an excerpt:

> Enough's enough. The World-Wide Web promises a new way to let people communicate. But too many Web designers are being bewitched by "multimedia" - they load their sites with gigantic graphics, embedded sound clips and animation. There's nothing wrong with that, as far as it goes. But increasingly, these Web designers are forgetting to include Lynx, one of the first Web browsers, in their HTML code.

> But Netscape is so cool.

> Yes, but not everybody can, or even wants to, use Netscape or Mosaic. Some of us are quite happy with our 286s and 386s and see no reason to spend several hundred dollars to upgrade to Windows...
