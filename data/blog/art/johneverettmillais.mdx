![Portrait](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Millais_-_Self-Portrait.jpg)

* British painter and illustrator of the Victorian era (1829 - 1896).
* A genius since childhood he ended up becoming the youngest student in the Royal Academy School at the age of eleven. 
* His professional career was full of success and his style perfectly matched the expectations of the Victorian era. 
* Along with Rossetti and Holman Hunt he was the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood in 1848.
* In 1850 he changed his colorful and detailed style to a more general and fluid one.
* His theme until then serious and morally correct is replaced with romantic and popular views, including children. 
* He would spend the rest of his life supporting his family with a steady production of popular plays. 
* Millais lived comfortably off the fruits of his labor and in 1885 he was named Baron, a very unusual title for a painter.
* Many consider that his remarkable genius was wasted since he used to please the popular demand merely for economic purposes.
