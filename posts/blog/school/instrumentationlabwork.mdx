# Worksheet 1 #

**Inductance and Capacitance**

Inductance is the property of an inductor of reacting to a change in its current by changing the energy of its magnetic field and generating an opposite voltage (counter electromotive force). The voltage of an inductor therefore must relate to a change in current $V_L = L(\frac{di}{dt})$ where L is the inductance constant of proportionality measured in Henrys.

The capacitance constant of the geometric configuration is the amount of charge that two bodies with a constant shape and spacing can store per volt-difference between them. This relation can be expressed as $C=\frac{q}{V}$

**Capacitance Printed Value**

The capacitance is normally printed in most plastic film types usually as micro or nano farads. Tolerances use upper case letters (M=±20%, K=±10%, J=±5%, H=±2.5% and F=±1pF), with K being the most common. Working voltage is also usually printed with a (V): 150n = 150nF; u47 = 0.47uF; 4n7 = 4.7nF.

Some capacitors use a three digit number system where the third digit is a picofarad multimeter: 474K 63 = 47x1^4pF = 0.47uF 63VDC ±10%; 102K 50 = 10x1^2pF = 0.001uF 50VDC ±10%.

Ceramic disk capacitors generally contain thermal tolerances (Z5U, K5U, X7R, COH, N2200). Whole numbers are usually pF and decimal numbers in uF. Odd looking numbers may use the three digit number system. 

**List of Components**

* Multimeter, Oscilloscope, Function Generator
* 2 Ceramic, 2 Polyester and 2 Electrolytic capacitors
* 1k, 4.7k Ohm Resistors, 2 Inductors, 1 0.22uF Capacitor
* 1 Rectifying Diode, 1 Switching Diode, 1 LED.

## Experiment 1 W1 ##

**Capacitance with Multimeter (SKIP)**

In capacitors the nominal capacitance is printed on the body. The maximum voltage depends on the insulator and if exceeded the dielectric breaks. Electrolytic capacitors have a polarity that needs to be identified.

1. Read the nominal capacitance of various capacitors and verify the value with a multimeter.

## Experiment 2 W1 ##

**Capacitance with AC Voltmeter**

This circuit configuration is limited to unpolarized capacitors starting from 1nF. Needs a sine wave of known frequency and a voltage lower than the capacitor's capacity.

1. Use an AC sine wave of 100Hz.
2. Connect the *unknown* capacitor in series with a 1k Ohm resistor.
3. Measure the voltage in the resistor.
4. Calculate the current in the loop as $I = \frac{V_R}{R}$
5. Use the current in the loop to measure the voltage in the capacitor.
6. Calculate the capacitance as:

$$

## Experiment 3 W1 ##

**Inductance with AC Voltmeter**

1. Connect the *unknown* inductance in series with a 1k Ohm resistor.
2. Measure the internal resistance of the inductor (here represented by the 1n Res).
3. Measure the voltage in the resistor and in the inductor.

$$

![Experiment Three](/static/images/notes/ExperimentThreeFromWorksheetOne.png)

## Questions W1 ##

1. In your own words what are the objectives and procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how to measure capacitance or inductance using instruments like the AC Voltmeter instead of using the  Multimeter. The procedure was to place the capacitor or the inductor in series with a resistance and using by using both voltages being able to solve for their values, in the case of the inductor we took into account the internal resistance of the component as an additional resistor in series.
2. You have all the necessary material to carry out the practice (not including multimeters, power supplies, oscilloscopes, or power generators signals / functions)? Yes, using the Proteus Simulator we can find all the necessary material to complete the practice.
3. What is the difference between a ceramic capacitor, a variable capacitor and a electrolytic capacitor? Ceramic capacitors are non polarized and made with a ceramic dielectric, they have a high frequency response but low voltage ratings. Variable capacitors are capacitors used when a continuous variation of the capacitance is needed (transmitters, receivers), they work by changing the distance or plate area overlap to control their capacitance. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors made up of a metallic anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielectric and a solid or wet electrolyte as its cathode. Electrolytic capacitors generally can't be used in AC circuits because of their polarity but have a high capacitance.

**Theory**

Power is the work done per unit of time, expressed in Joules per second. Electrical power is the work or energy dissipated in a certain load per unit of time, expressed in Watts. The power in DC in a load is $P = V_L I_L$ therefore it can be measured simply by using an Ammeter and a Voltmeter.

The direct measurement of the load voltage and current may be different because of the internal resistances of the Ammeter and Voltmeter. The difference can be of the order of $\frac{|R_L - R_I|}{R_L}$ where $R_L$ is the load's resistance and $R_I$ is the instrument's resistance.

In AC circuits we use the *3 Voltmeter* method. In this configuration the real power dissipated by the load is $P = \frac{V_m I_m}{2}$ to do the previous calculation we need to use $R$ since we don't know the current, therefore ending with the relation: 

$$
P_L = \frac{V_{AC}^2 - V_{AB}^2 - V_{BC}^2}{2R}
$$

**List of Components**

* 1 Power source, 1 Autotransformer, 3 Multimeters
* 1 Power resistor of 10Ohm and 1 of 20 Ohm
* 1 Ceramic Capacitor of 0.22uF, 1 Resistor of 18Ohm

## Experiment 1 W2 ##

**Power Measurement in DC circuits**

1. Place the voltmeter and the ammeter in series with the source and 10Ohm.
2. Calculate and compare the power from both configurations.
3. Notice the effect of the internal resistances of the Ammeter or Voltmeter.

![Experiment One](/static/images/notes/ExperimentOneWorsheetTwo.png)

## Experiment 2 W2 ##

**Power measurement in AC circuits**

1. Place 3 voltmeters forming a series circuit with an AC source (20Vpp).
2. Use a power resistance of 2Ohms (R) and a power resistance of 10Ohms (Load)
3. Calculate the power in the load using the indicated method.
4. Repeat by placing a 10Ohm resistor (Load) and a 0.22uF capacitor.

## Questions W2 ##

1. In your own words what are the objectives and procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how to measure the power being used by a general load represented in this case by a power resistor using instruments like the Voltmeter and Ammeter instead of using a Multimeter. The procedure was to place the load in series with a DC source first, here we can directly measure the voltage and current needed to calculate the power of the load, only taking into account the small error that could arise from the internal resistance of the instruments. Later on we used the 3 voltmeter method when applying an AC signal to the load, this method requires the help of an additional resistance.
2. You have all the necessary material to carry out the practice (not including multimeters, power supplies, oscilloscopes, or power generators signals / functions)? Yes, using the Proteus Simulator we can find all the necessary material to complete the practice.
3. In what type of energy is the potential and kinetic energy of the free electrons that flow inside a conductor transformed? Is this process reversible? Into usable electrical energy and some thermal. The process is not completely reversible as some of the energy will be lost.

**Theory**

Circuit bridges are devices used in measuring instruments that measure unknown resistances, capacitances or inductances. Bridges use DC sources when measuring resistances and AC sources when measuring inductances or capacitances. We are able to make the comparison when there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, meaning that the voltage on its terminals is the same (bridge in equilibrium). 

![Wheatstone Bridge](/static/images/notes/WheatstoneBridgeImageIntruLab.png)

The Wheatstone Bridge is used when measuring resistances and uses a DC source.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{R_1}{R_4} = \frac{R_2}{R_x} \implies R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}\\\\
	V_A = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right)\\
	V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = V_A - V_B \land V_{AB} = 0 \implies V_A = V_B\\
	(V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) = \left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	(R_4)(R_x + R_2) = (R_x)(R_4 + R_1)\\
	R_4 R_x + R_4 R_2 = R_x R_4 + R_x R_1\\
	R_4 R_2 = R_x R_1 \therefore R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}
\end{gathered}
$$

The resistance itself of $R_x$ can vary by a small amount $\Delta R$ from phenomena like thermal changes, its new resistance will be $R_x = R_x + \Delta R$ . This small variation in the unknown resistance needs to be taken into account to measure the *true* voltage differential $V_{AB}$ that we will use for example when measuring the temperature with a thermistor.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_A = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right)\\
	V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2 \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	\pm\Delta V_{AB} = V_A - V_B\\
	V_A - V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) - (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2 \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_A - V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R}{R + R}\right) - (V_S)\left(\frac{R}{R + R \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = (V_S)\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{R}{2R \pm \Delta R} \right)\\
	V_{AB} = (V_S)\left(\frac{2R \pm \Delta R - 2R}{4R \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = \left(\frac{V_S}{4R}\right)\\
	\pm\Delta V_{AB} = \pm \Delta R\left(\frac{V_S}{4R}\right)
	\therefore \Delta R = \left(\frac{V_{AB} 4 R}{V_S}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

From the equation we see that the maximum voltage differential from a small variation in $R_x$ happens when $R_1 = R_4 \text{ and } R_2 = R_x$ . 

![Capacitance Bridge](/static/images/notes/CapacitanceComparisonBridgeIntruLab.png)

The Capacitance Comparison Bridge is used when measuring inductances or capacitances and uses an AC source. When balanced we know that:

$$
R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1} \;\text{ and }\; C_x = \frac{R_1 C_4}{R_2} 
$$

![Resonance Bridge](/static/images/notes/ResonanceBridgeInstruLab.png)

Resonance Bridges are used when measuring frequencies from a balance condition. When balanced we know that:

$$
f = \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sqrt{LC})} 
$$

**List of Components**

* 1 Power Source, Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Multimeter
* 1 capacitor 0.22uF and 1 capacitor 0.33uF, 1 Thermistor 4.7kOhm
* 1 Preset of 100Ohm, 1 Potentiometer of 10kOhm and 1 potentiometer of 5kOhm
* Resistors: 4 2.2Ohm, 3 56kOhm, 2 10kOhm, 2 4.7kOhm
* Resistors: 1 47kOhm, 1 1kOhm, 1 2.2kOhm, 1 3.9kOhm, 1 1Ohm

## Experiment 1 W3 ##

**Thermistor with Wheatstone**

1. Build a Wheatstone Bridge using R1 = R4 = 10kΩ
2. R2 = 10kΩ potentiometer. Rx = PTC Thermistor
4. Power Source is 10VDC
5. Take 3 measurements: 25°C, 40°C, 120°C.
6. Indicate voltages, potentiometer and thermistor resistance.

$$
R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}
$$

![Experiment One](/static/images/notes/ExperimentOneWorksheetThreeInstrumentationLab.png)

| Temp | Voltages | Potentiometer | Thermistor | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 25 | 5-5 | 1000 | $\frac{(1k)(10k)}{10k} = 1k$ |
| 40 | 5.08-4.92 | 1100 | $\frac{(1.1k)(10k)}{10k} = 1.1k$ |
| 120 | 5.09-4.91 | 1500 | $\frac{(1.5k)(10k)}{10k} = 1.5k$ |

In this experiment we learned to measure the unknown resistance of a PTC thermistor using a Wheatstone Bridge. The derivation of the equation we used to calculate the resistance refers to equating the voltages of the two voltage dividers.

Since there is still some current traveling in the middle value of the second and third test it’s safe to assume that the true value of the unknown resistance would be approximately 1050Ω and 1450Ω respectively.

## Experiment 2 W3 ##

**Resistor Temp Variation Wheatstone**

1. Build a Wheatstone Bridge using R1 = R4 = R2 = 56kΩ
2. R3 = 10kΩ potentiometer + 47k Ω
3. Power Source is 10VDC, balance the bridge with R3
4. Heat the 47k Ω resistor to a small increase (47.1k Ω)
5. Observe the voltage variation and calculate the resistor change.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_{AB} = \Delta R\left(-\frac{V_S}{4R_2}\right) \implies \Delta R = \left(\frac{V_{AB} 4 R_2}{-V_S}\right)\\
	V_{1} = -0.12mV \land V_{2} = -2.35mV\\
	V_{AB} = -2.23mV\\
	\Delta R = \left(\frac{(-0.00223)(4)(56000)}{-(10)}\right) = 49.952 \Omega \approx 50 \Omega\\
	\therefore \Delta R = 50
\end{gathered}
$$

![Experiment Two W3](/static/images/notes/BalancingBridgeTestyWorkThreeInstrumentationLab.png)

In this experiment we learned how most resistors, when subjected to a change in temperature will respond with a change in their resistance (in the same way as a thermistor does), in this case by simulating a change of 50 Ω in the 47k Ω resistor we are also unbalancing the bridge with a net deflection in its voltage reading. 

By knowing the magnitude of the voltage difference, we are able to calculate the unknown change in the resistor caused by a change in temperature. The relation between the resistance difference and the voltage difference also refers to equating the voltages of the two voltage dividers.

## Experiment 3 W3 ##

**Capacitance comparison bridge**

1. Build a Capacitance Comparison Bridge using Z2 = Z4 = 47Ω
2. Z1 = 100 Ω potentiometer + C4 = 0.22uF and Cx = 0.33uF.
3. Power Source is AC 2Sin(2000pi t) V
4. Measure the value of the potentiometer
5. Calculate unknown Cx and Rx from the potentiometer value.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	C_x = \frac{(69\Omega)(0.22\,\mu \text{F})}{(47\Omega)} = 0.3229787234 \,\mu \text{F} \approx 0.323 \,\mu \text{F}\\
	R_x = \frac{(47\Omega)(47\Omega)}{(69\Omega)} = 32.01449275 \Omega \approx 32.0145\Omega
\end{gathered}
$$

![Experiment Three W3](/static/images/notes/ExperimentThreeWorksheet3InstrumentationLab.png)

In this experiment we learned to measure the unknown resistance and capacitance of two components using a Capacitor Comparison Bridge, which in some regards can be considered a variation of the Wheatstone Bridge designed to use an AC source by including additional impedances in equilibrium. Like in previous bridges we can calculate the value of the resistance and the capacitance simply by balancing the bridge using both potentiometers.

## Questions W3 ##

1. In your own words, what are the objectives and the procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how use bridges as part of measuring instruments for unknown impedances, for example to detect the small changes in the resistance of a transducer like the thermistor. The procedure was to place the component with the unknown value on one side of the bridge and a variable component equivalent on the other, between them stands a null detector to indicate that the bridge is balanced when adjusting the variable component. Once balanced we can calculate the impedance from the principle of voltage dividers.
2. Do you have all the necessary material to do the practice (not including: multimeters, power sources, oscilloscopes or signal generators / functions)? Yes
3. What is the difference between the Wheatstone bridge, the capacitance comparison bridge and the resonance point? The Wheatstone Bridge is used when measuring resistances and uses a DC source. The Capacitance Comparison Bridge is used when measuring inductances or capacitances and uses an AC source. Resonance Bridges are used when measuring frequencies in an AC inductive or capacitive circuit.
4. In general, how are measuring bridges balanced? By changing the variable resistance of one of the resistors, using a potentiometer for example, while measuring the current flowing in the middle through the galvanometer, we say that the bridge is balanced when the current reaches zero.

**Theory**



The main objective is to learn the fundamental principles and operation of optoelectronic devices to isolate the input system from the output system and the special configurations needed when working with AC or DC sources. 

Optocouplers
An optocoupler combines, on the same base, an LED and a photodetector. Figure 1
shows an optocoupler formed by an LED and a photodiode; the first is on the left and the
second, on the right, the voltage that feeds the LED causes it to emit light that will affect
the photodiode. The light striking the photodiode creates a reverse current that passes
through resistor R2. The photodiode voltage is:
sal ss 2 V = V - IR
This output voltage will depend on the magnitude of the reverse current. If the
voltage feeding the LED is modified, the light intensity, the photodiode current and,
consequently, Vout vary. If the LED current has a variation of AC, Vout will have the same
variation of AC
The main advantage of the optocoupler is the electrical isolation between the LED
circuit and the photodiode circuit; It is common for the resistance between the input circuit
and the output circuit to be greater than 1010 Ω. For this reason, the optocoupler is also
known as an "optoisolator"; the only contact between the input and output circuits is the
light beam.

An optocoupler is an electronic component that transfers a signal between two isolated circuits using light. They are used to isolate parts of the system to prevent high voltages from affecting the rest of the components that receive the signal. Generally it is the combination of a light emitter, for example a LED, and photosensitive device like a photodetector. The incoming signal will determine the LED's brightness that will then be interpreted by the photodetector to recover the original signal as its output.

In this experiment we learned the different relations that the optocouplers 4N26 and PC817 have between their input and output voltage, at least in an expected range of operating input voltages from 2V to 14V we can see clearly that the 4N26 optocoupler has a high linearity while the PC817 exhibits a nonlinear behavior. We can also use both components’ datasheets to see how this behavior could change depending on the operating temperature.

Test 1 Using MOC3021

When we press the button, the measured current that the MOC3021 uses is 24.6 mA while the auxiliary triac Q4004L4 is driving a current of 3.46 A directly from the AC (120V 60Hz) alternator used by the lamp. We need the auxiliary triac since the datasheet specifies that we can’t use the MOC3021 directly to power loads that draw from an AC source and it is limited to an absolute maximum rating of 50mA.
MOC3021 Datasheet:
https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/239/MOC302-1175440.pdf

In this experiment we learned the importance of reading the electrical maximum ratings of every component we use since the optocoupler of the circuit will be damaged if we tried to drive the current that the lamp draws from the AC source directly from the MOC3021 triac.
Questions Worksheet 4
In your own words, what are the objectives and the procedure of the practice?
The main objective was to learn how to use optocouplers as circuit isolators and their different circuit configurations based on the type of optocoupler used (Transistor Based, SCR, TRIAC etc). The procedure of the three experiments done involved assembling the optocoupler configuration circuits for the 4N26, PC817 and MOC3021 and testing their behavior depending on their input voltage and current and what the current needed by the device they needed to power.
Explain in your own words what an optocoupler is and what is its main function?
An optocoupler is a device that allows an electrical signal to be transmitted between two isolated circuits, their properties are useful since they can isolate low voltage devices from high voltage circuits, this is essential to be able to avoid damage or disruptions from high voltage surges. They can also be used with triacs to drive large AC voltages from small digital signals and are a tool that can be used to remove electrical noise from signals.
What are the two main parts of an optocoupler?
A transmitter diode, usually a LED or IRED, that encodes the incoming signal into light and receiver, usually a photosensor diode, that decodes the incoming light signal form the transmitter.
Describe at least two types of optocouplers
Two types of optocouplers are TRIAC based and SCR based optocouplers, both can use GaAs infrared LED as their transmitter but differ on their photosensitive part, the first uses a TRIAC or triode for alternating current that can conduct current in either direction when triggered, intended to be used with devices that draw from an AC line, while the second uses a SCR or silicon-controlled rectifier and can only conduct current in one direction.






























Question 2

what is the difference between accuracy, precision and repeatability?

Cual es la diferencia entre exactitud, precision y repetibilidad?

Your Answer:
Accuracy is the closeness of the readings in relation to the true value. Precision is the closeness of the readings in relation to each other and is relatated to repeatability that is the presicion of the instrumen's measurements while being turned on and off, where a high repeatability corresponds to a low drift.

Question 5
1 / 1 pts
what is a thermistor and how does it work? what are their main applications?

¿Qué es un termistor y cómo funciona? ¿Cuáles son sus principales aplicaciones? 

Your Answer:
The Thermally Sensitive Resistor or Thermistor is a temperature sensing element composed of sintered semiconductor material with a large change in resistance from a small change in temperature. It provides a high accuracy from ±0.05% to ±0.02%, high electrical noise immunity, easy to interface and high sensitivity over its small temperature range. They work with a very small current reducing heat losses in its wiring. Their small size makes them susceptible to self heating errors and later prone to irreversible de-calibration (extreme drift).

Question 7
0.9 / 1 pts
what is the difference between bandwidth and cut-off frequency?

¿Cuál es la diferencia entre el ancho de banda y la frecuencia de corte? 

Your Answer:
Cut-Off frequency is the frequency at which the output falls to 70.7% of its stable output value. This is equivalent to a difference of -3dB and represents the point at which the output power is halved while bandwidth represents the range of frequencies between 0 and the Cut-Off frequency indicating the instrument's response speed.

you wrote 70.7% but then you said output power is halved. Is not half but 70.7%. bandwidth is not related to the response speed, but to the range of frequencies the sensor or instrument can measure
 
Question 8
0.75 / 0.75 pts
What is the difference between reactive and apparent power?

Cual es la diferencia entre potencia reactiva y aparente?

Your Answer:
Reactive power is the power stored from inductive or capacitive components that add to the real power that the circuit is actually using, therefore increasing the apparent power or power that is measured when taking into account the circuit as a whole. They are normally related using a power factor.

Question 9
1 / 1 pts
What are the disadvantages of sensors that require mechanical contact against contactless (proximity) sensors? write at least two advantages

cuales son las desventajas de sensores que requieren contacto mecánico contra sensores de contacto o de proximidad? escribe al menos dos ventajas

Your Answer:
Some advantages of contactless proximity sensors over their mechanical counterparts is that they don't need to calculate and set the angle of approach of the objects they are measuring, the don't wear out since they have no moving parts. Additionally, mechanical contact sensors will require more maintenance time and will eventually suffer from corrosion.

Question 12
1 / 1 pts
What is the working principle of inductive sensors? and what are their main parts?

Cual es el principio de funcionamiento de los sensores inductivos? y cuales son su partes principales?

Your Answer:
Inductive proximity sensors work by generating a magnetic field through a coil and then using an oscillator (LC circuit) to generate a sinusoidal signal proportional to the magnetic field. As the metallic target passes in front of the sensor the amplitude of the sinewave changes as a response to the change in permeability. A trigger senses the change in amplitude and generates a response proportional to the target's distance.

Schering bridges are used in a similar way to capacitor comparison bridges where they can be used to measure the value of components such as capacitors and inductors, their main advantage is that the balance equation is independent of the frequency used.

 

how do they work? they work by adjusting a variable resistor (pot) until the bridge is balanced (the detector measures a value of 0 amps)






FILTERS

The main objective is to know how to work with elements that are designed to pass certain signals with desired frequencies and reject or attenuate others. The procedure involves making six experiments by constructing passive high, passive low, active high, active low, second order active low and active band pass circuit configurations and testing how the incoming signal beheaves compared to the output signal. For most of the circuit configurations we will use the LM741 Op-Amp.
A filter is a device or process that removes some unwanted components like frequencies, frequency bands or other features from a signal and they are used in signal processing.





The main objective is to learn how oscillator circuits work and how stable they remain at multiple frequencies; to learn how analog to digital converters or ADCs and digital to analog converters or DACs work; to learn how to implement ADCs and DACs for conversion operations and to perform a data acquisition application using both converters. The procedure is to build speaker with an NE555 oscillator to determine the range of frequencies we can hear, create an analog to digital converter of 6 digital levels using LM311 comparators, digitalize the output of a LM35 analog temperature sensor and then use the ADC of 6 digital levels to turn on a certain number of LEDs and finally model the 8 digital level ADC808 behavior using LM741 and NE555.

A general oscillator is a system that creates periodic disturbances in a medium such as sound or electromagnetic field waves. An electronic oscillator is an electrical device that generates a continuous, periodic, alternating waveform of a certain frequency as its output with a unidirectional DC current as its input signal. By pairing a capacitor and an inductor with two inverting OpAmps we can create a simple oscillator.

An analog to digital converter is an electrical device capable of translating analog signals into discrete digital values for easier processing and for making them immune to interferences. You can create an ADC using multiple OpAmps such LM741 or with the help integrated circuits (IC) like the LM311.

1. What do you understand by a sensor? Do you know the difference between a sensor and an actuator? A sensor is device that measures a physical magnitude and transforms the measurement into electrical signals. Actuators are devices that use the electrical energy emitted by sensors or controllers transforming it into mechanical energy or motion. Some actuators convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy.
2. What characteristics (static and dynamic) of sensors do you know? Static: Sensitivity, resolution, drift, range, repeatability, reproducibility. Dynamic: Rise, delay, peaks, time error and steady state error.
3. What do you understand by signal conditioning methods? What do you understand by signal conditioning methods? Signal conditioning is the processing of signals to make them suitable as input to other devices like actuators. Examples of methods used in signal conditioning are filtering, amplification, attenuation and linearization.
4. Do you know the operational amplifiers and have used them? What have you done with them? They are electronic components used for amplifying voltage, this amplification is determined by external feedback components. I have used them to design filters, but they can be used as the basis for comparators, rectifiers, converters and most signal conditioning methods.
5. Do you know the types of triangular signals, pulse train, saw tooth? Yes, they represent different signal behaviors or changes over time. Triangular waves mean that the signal increases and decreases linearly. Pulse waves mean that the signal oscillates between on and off, the proportion of time they remain on depends on their duty cycle, square waves are a kind of pulse wave with a duty cycle of 50%. Saw waves are similar to triangular waves in that they increase linearly but can only decrease in a sharp vertical drop, they can be considered an extremely asymmetric triangle wave.
6. What is PWM? Method of decreasing the average power of a signal by dividing its output into a discrete pulse wave, the intervals when the signal is turned off in the pulse wave are what causes the overall power reduction.
7. What do you know about industrial instrumentation and its standards? Not very much. I think it might relate to the correct way of using sensors and actuators in an industrial process.
8. Have you physically used a multimeter or (voltmeter or ammeter), a signal generator (or functions) and an oscilloscope? Yes, I have used a multimeter a function generator and an oscilloscope for basic circuit testing.
