<p>The most essential technology in any human society is language, today more than ever we have a responsibility of sharing and enriching it. This means that it&#x27;s not enough to just have literate citizens, from the speed at which our lifestyle is changing we must also have <em>true readers</em>. Being a good or bad reader depends solely on how many positive and rewarding contacts a person has had with the written culture. Reading groups are a place dedicated solely to the proliferation of these positive contacts.</p>
<p>Simple reading is the activity of constructing meaning from a text, we read to understand. In contrast, creative reading arises from the will to engage in these encounters, leaving our mundane obligations behind and surrendering ourselves to the experience. Creative reading is reading that creates. Reading groups should have a diversity of texts for all interests to be satisfied. There must also be a diversity of places in which the reading groups develop.</p>
<p>Many factors will influence its success: Characteristics of the text, the reader, the place, and the context in general. Each group will require its own specific teaching style and method. When searching for new the books, the group coordinator must have read the options and ask its members which ones they would like to read next. It is essential that the books can be borrowed, either from a library or other members.</p>
<p>It is best not to include activities that might appear academic in nature or that they may indicate that the purpose of the group is to evaluate the reader. The activities will have the objective of <em>tasting the textual and paratextual experiences</em>. Reading interesting parts aloud is also a good technique so that from our intonation and pronunciation we transmit the meaning that we have already given to the text.</p>
<p>On this subject Felipe Garrido wrote a book called <em>How To Read Aloud</em>. From that book we know that reading aloud requires good breath control, modest body language, a brief introduction of what is going to be read and above all making sure that there will be no interruptions. Remember that you don&#x27;t read to a public, you read with the public.</p>
<p>Writing helps us to get away from our immediate language and exercise a reflective and retrospective language, in reading groups everybody should have the feeling that they are <em>learning to read as writers and to write as readers</em>. Games are also a vital part of energizing the group: riddles, tongue twisters, <em>retah√≠las</em> (poems where memory is put to the test by adding new words), <em>jitanj√°foras</em> (entirely nonsensical poems), poems with a linguistic condition, etc. Games release the accumulated tension of sitting for long periods of time.</p>
<p>When consolidating a reading group, their activities should be actively promoted with the community via brochures, bulletin boards, book exhibitions, etc. in order to create a reading culture in the community. As a coordinator, it is advisable to have a <em>Grosso Modo</em> or record of the progress and relevant events that happen in the group. The person in charge of the record needs to be very observant. This record is not a report but a reflective exercise of the performance of the group as a whole and of the coordinator as an individual.</p>
