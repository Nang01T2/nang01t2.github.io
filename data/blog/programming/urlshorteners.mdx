We have all been exposed to shortened links, either for the convenience to share them, for the money they can generate through ads, or for the quantitative data that a company can use to measure its impact online. A shortened URL or link allows us to easily transmit it by instant messaging, personalize the hyperlink and obtain detailed data about the people who have visited it. The [Branded Short Domains](http://www.vanityurlshorteners.com/), also called *Vanity URLs* allow a company to use third-party redirection services to maintain a consistent domain across its brand.

Despite its advantages, this class of links also presents a series of problems. Monetization has led to its use for widespread spam; the death of a shortening service generates Linkrot; obfuscation of the original site can be used to redirect to malware and the keys in some cases are vulnerable to brute force attacks. This has led large companies such as Google and Twitter to establish their own servers (goo.gl and t.co) to shorten links, thereby avoiding dependencies on third party servers, increasing security and stability of the service.

Usually a *key* is added to the URL of the domain of the site that is dedicated to shortening the URLs. The service then uses that key to create a small site on its server. The function of this new site will be to collect data, display ads or simply redirect to the final destination. The generated key is usually obtained with a hash function or with a random number to later be transformed into its number base 36 or 62. Generally shorteners present the option of using a custom key or domain.
